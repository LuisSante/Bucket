Christian England Martin the Reading warder is found guilty of
feeding the hungry nursing the sick of being kindly and humane These
are his offences in plain unofficial language

system is opposed to all that is kind and helpful Herein is shown a
process that is dehumanizing not only to the prisoners but to every
one connected with it

employment and in poor circumstances Can anyone help him

SOME CRUELTIES OF PRISON LIFE


                   THE EDITOR OF THE DAILY CHRONICLE

SIRI learn with great regret through an extract from the columns of
your paper that the warder Martin of Reading Prison has been
dismissed by the Prison Commissioners for having given some sweet
biscuits to a little hungry child I saw the three children myself on
the Monday preceding my release They had just been convicted and were
standing in a row in the central hall in their prison dress carrying
their sheets under the arms previous to their being sent to the cells
allotted to them I happened to be passing along one of the galleries on
my way to the reception room where I was to have an interview with a
friend They were quite small children the youngestthe one to whom
the warder gave the biscuitsbeing a tiny little chap for whom they
had evidently been unable to find clothes small enough to fit I had of
course seen many children in prison during the two years during which I
was myself confined Wandsworth Prison especially contained always a
large number of children But the little child I saw on the afternoon of
Monday the th at Reading was tinier than any one of them I need
not say how utterly distressed I was to see these children at Reading
for I knew the treatment in store for them The cruelty that is
practised by day and night on children in English prisons is incredible
except to those who have witnessed it and are aware of the brutality of
the system

People nowadays do not understand what cruelty is They regard it as a
sort of terrible medival passion and connect it with the race of men
like Eccelin da Romano and others to whom the deliberate infliction of
pain gave a real madness of pleasure But men of the stamp of Eccelin
are merely abnormal types of perverted individualism Ordinary cruelty
is simply stupidity It comes from the entire want of imagination It is
the result in our days of stereotyped systems of hardandfast rules
of centralisation of officialism and of irresponsible authority
Wherever there is centralisation there is stupidity What is inhuman in
modern life is officialism Authority is as destructive to those who
exercise it as it is to those on whom it is exercised It is the Prison
Board with the system that it carries out that is the primary source
of the cruelty that is exercised on a child in prison The people who
uphold the system have excellent intentions Those who carry it out are
humane in intention also Responsibility is shifted on to the
disciplinary regulations It is supposed that because a thing is the
rule it is right

The present treatment of children is terrible primarily from people not
understanding the peculiar psychology of a childs nature A child can
understand a punishment inflicted by an individual such as a parent or
guardian and bear it with a certain amount of acquiescence What it
cannot understand is a punishment inflicted by Society It cannot
realise what Society is With grown people it is of course the
reverse Those of us who are either in prison or have been sent there
can understand and do understand what that collective force called
Society means and whatever we may think of its methods or claims we
can force ourselves to accept it Punishment inflicted on us by an
individual on the other hand is a thing that no grown person endures
or is expected to endure

The child consequently being taken away from its parents by people whom
it has never seen and of whom it knows nothing and finding itself in
a lonely and unfamiliar cell waited on by strange faces and ordered
about and punished by the representatives of a system that it cannot
understand becomes an immediate prey to the first and most prominent
emotion produced by modern prison lifethe emotion of terror The
terror of a child in prison is quite limitless I remember once in
Reading as I was going out to exercise seeing in the dimlylit cell
right opposite my own a small boy Two warders not unkindly men were
talking to him with some sternness apparently or perhaps giving him
some useful advice about his conduct One was in the cell with him the
other was standing outside The childs face was like a white wedge of
sheer terror There was in his eyes the mute appeal of a hunted animal
The next morning I heard him at breakfasttime crying and calling to be
let out His cry was for his parents From time to time I could hear the
deep voice of the warder on duty warning him to keep quiet Yet he was
not even convicted of whatever little offence he had been charged with
He was simply on remand That I knew by his wearing his own clothes
which seemed neat enough He was however wearing prison socks and
shoes This showed that he was a very poor boy whose own shoes if he
had any were in a bad state Justices and magistrates an entirely
ignorant class as a rule often remand children for a week and then
perhaps remit whatever sentence they are entitled to pass They call
this not sending a child to prison It is of course a stupid view on
their part To a little child whether he is in prison on remand or
after conviction is a subtlety of social position he cannot comprehend
To him the horrible thing is to be there at all In the eyes of humanity
it should be a horrible thing for him to be there at all

This terror that seizes and dominates the child as it seizes the grown
man also is of course intensified beyond power of expression by the
solitary cellular system of our prisons Every child is confined to its
cell for twentythree hours out of the twentyfour This is the
appalling thing To shut up a child in a dimlylit cell for twentythree
hours out of the twentyfour is an example of the cruelty of stupidity
If an individual parent or guardian did this to a child he would be
severely punished The Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
would take the matter up at once There would be on all hands the utmost
detestation of whomsoever had been guilty of such cruelty A heavy
sentence would undoubtedly follow conviction But our own actual society
does worse itself and to the child to be so treated by a strange
abstract force of whose claims it has no cognizance is much worse than
it would be to receive the same treatment from its father or mother or
someone it knew The inhuman treatment of a child is always inhuman by
whomsoever it is inflicted But inhuman treatment by Society is to the
child the more terrible because there is no appeal A parent or guardian
can be moved and let out the child from the dark lonely room in which
it is confined But a warder cannot Most warders are very fond of
children But the system prohibits them from rendering the child any
assistance Should they do so as Warder Martin did they are dismissed

The second thing from which a child suffers in prison is hunger The
food that is given to it consists of a piece of usually badlybaked
prison bread and a tin of water for breakfast at halfpast seven At
twelve oclock it gets dinner composed of a tin of coarse Indian meal
stirabout and at halfpast five it gets a piece of dry bread and a tin
of water for its supper This diet in the case of a strong grown man is
always productive of illness of some kind chiefly of course
diarrhoea with its attendant weakness In fact in a big prison
astringent medicines are served out regularly by the warders as a matter
of course In the case of a child the child is as a rule incapable of
eating the food at all Anyone who knows anything about children knows
how easily a childs digestion is upset by a fit of crying or trouble
and mental distress of any kind A child who has been crying all day
long and perhaps half the night in a lonely dimlylit cell and is
preyed upon by terror simply cannot eat food of this coarse horrible
kind In the case of the little child to whom Warder Martin gave the
biscuits the child was crying with hunger on Tuesday morning and
utterly unable to eat the bread and water served to it for its
breakfast Martin went out after the breakfasts had been served and
bought the few sweet biscuits for the child rather than see it starving
It was a beautiful action on his part and was so recognised by the
child who utterly unconscious of the regulation of the Prison Board
told one of the senior warders how kind this junior warder had been to
him The result was of course a report and a dismissal

I know Martin extremely well and I was under his charge for the last
seven weeks of my imprisonment On his appointment at Reading he had
charge of Gallery C in which I was confined so I saw him constantly I
was struck by the singular kindness and humanity of the way in which he
spoke to me and to the other prisoners Kind words are much in prison
and a pleasant Good morning or Good evening will make one as happy
as one can be in solitary confinement He was always gentle and
considerate I happen to know another case in which he showed great
kindness to one of the prisoners and I have no hesitation in mentioning
it One of the most horrible things in prison is the badness of the
sanitary arrangements No prisoner is allowed under any circumstances to
leave his cell after halfpast five pm If consequently he is
suffering from diarrhoea he has to use his cell as a latrine and
pass the night in a most fetid and unwholesome atmosphere Some days
before my release Martin was going the rounds at halfpast seven with
one of the senior warders for the purpose of collecting the oakum and
tools of the prisoners A man just convicted and suffering from
violent diarrhoea in consequence of the food as is always the case
asked this senior warder to allow him to empty the slops in his cell on
account of the horrible odour of the cell and the possibility of illness
again in the night The senior warder refused absolutely it was against
the rules The man as far as he was concerned had to pass the night in
this dreadful condition Martin however rather than see this wretched
man in such a loathsome predicament said he would empty the mans slops
himself and did so A warder emptying a prisoners slops is of course
against the rules but Martin did this act of kindness to the man out of
the simple humanity of his nature and the man was naturally most
grateful

As regards the children a great deal has been talked and written lately
about the contaminating influence of prison on young children What is
said is quite true A child is utterly contaminated by prison life But
the contaminating influence is not that of the prisoners It is that of
the whole prison systemof the governor the chaplain the warders the
lonely cell the isolation the revolting food the rules of the Prison
Commissioners the mode of discipline as it is termed of the life
Every care is taken to isolate a child from the sight even of all
prisoners over sixteen years of age Children sit behind a curtain in
chapel and are sent to take exercise in small sunless yardssometimes
a stoneyard sometimes a yard at the back of the millsrather than
that they should see the elder prisoners at exercise But the only
really humanising influence in prison is the influence of the prisoners
Their cheerfulness under terrible circumstances their sympathy for each
other their humility their gentleness their pleasant smiles of
greeting when they meet each other their complete acquiescence in their
punishments are all quite wonderful and I myself learnt many sound
lessons from them I am not proposing that the children should not sit
behind a curtain in chapel or that they should take exercise in a
corner of the common yard I am merely pointing out that the bad
influence on children is not and could never be that of the prisoners
but is and will always remain that of the prison system itself There
is not a single man in Reading Gaol that would not gladly have done the
three childrens punishment for them When I saw them last it was on the
Tuesday following their conviction I was taking exercise at halfpast
eleven with about twelve other men as the three children passed near
us in charge of a warder from the damp dreary stoneyard in which
they had been at their exercise I saw the greatest pity and sympathy in
the eyes of my companions as they looked at them Prisoners are as a
class extremely kind and sympathetic to each other Suffering and the
community of suffering makes people kind and day after day as I tramped
the yard I used to feel with pleasure and comfort what Carlyle calls
somewhere the silent rhythmic charm of human companionship In this as
in all other things philanthropists and people of that kind are astray
It is not the prisoners who need reformation It is the prisons

Of course no child under fourteen years of age should be sent to prison
at all It is an absurdity and like many absurdities of absolutely
tragic results If however they are to be sent to prison during the
daytime they should be in a workshop or schoolroom with a warder At
night they should sleep in a dormitory with a nightwarder to look
after them They should be allowed exercise for at least three hours a
day The dark badlyventilated illsmelling prison cells are dreadful
for a child dreadful indeed for anyone One is always breathing bad air
in prison The food given to children should consist of tea and
breadandbutter and soup Prison soup is very good and wholesome A
resolution of the House of Commons could settle the treatment of
children in half an hour I hope you will use your influence to have
this done The way that children are treated at present is really an
outrage on humanity and commonsense It comes from stupidity

Let me draw attention now to another terrible thing that goes on in
English prisons indeed in prisons all over the world where the system
of silence and cellular confinement is practised I refer to the large
number of men who become insane or weakminded in prison In convict
prisons this is of course quite common but in ordinary gaols also
such as that I was confined in it is to be found

About three months ago I noticed amongst the prisoners who took
exercise with me a young man who seemed to me to be silly or
halfwitted Every prison of course has its halfwitted clients who
return again and again and may be said to live in the prison But this
young man struck me as being more than usually halfwitted on account of
his silly grin and idiotic laughter to himself and the peculiar
restlessness of his eternally twitching hands He was noticed by all the
other prisoners on account of the strangeness of his conduct From time
to time he did not appear at exercise which showed me that he was being
punished by confinement to his cell Finally I discovered that he was
under observation and being watched night and day by warders When he
did appear at exercise he always seemed hysterical and used to walk
round crying or laughing At chapel he had to sit right under the
observation of two warders who carefully watched him all the time
Sometimes he would bury his head in his hands an offence against the
chapel regulations and his head would be immediately struck up by a
warder so that he should keep his eyes fixed permanently in the
direction of the Communiontable Sometimes he would crynot making any
disturbancebut with tears streaming down his face and a hysterical
throbbing in the throat Sometimes he would grin idiotlike to himself
and make faces He was on more than one occasion sent out of chapel to
his cell and of course he was continually punished As the bench on
which I used to sit in chapel was directly behind the bench at the end
of which this unfortunate man was placed I had full opportunity of
observing him I also saw him of course at exercise continually and I
saw that he was becoming insane and was being treated as if he was
shamming

On Saturday week last I was in my cell at about one oclock occupied in
cleaning and polishing the tins I had been using for dinner Suddenly I
was startled by the prison silence being broken by the most horrible and
revolting shrieks or rather howls for at first I thought some animal
like a bull or a cow was being unskilfully slaughtered outside the
prison walls I soon realised however that the howls proceeded from
the basement of the prison and I knew that some wretched man was being
flogged I need not say how hideous and terrible it was for me and I
began to wonder who it was who was being punished in this revolting
manner Suddenly it dawned upon me that they might be flogging this
unfortunate lunatic My feelings on the subject need not be chronicled
they have nothing to do with the question

The next day Sunday th I saw the poor fellow at exercise his weak
ugly wretched face bloated by tears and hysteria almost beyond
recognition He walked in the centre ring along with the old men the
beggars and the lame people so that I was able to observe him the whole
time It was my last Sunday in prison a perfectly lovely day the
finest day we had had the whole year and there in the beautiful
sunlight walked this poor creaturemade once in the image of
Godgrinning like an ape and making with his hands the most fantastic
gestures as though he was playing in the air on some invisible stringed
instrument or arranging and dealing counters in some curious game All
the while these hysterical tears without which none of us ever saw
him were making soiled runnels on his white swollen face The hideous
and deliberate grace of his gestures made him like an antic He was a
living grotesque The other prisoners all watched him and not one of
them smiled Everybody knew what had happened to him and that he was
being driven insanewas insane already After halfanhour he was
ordered in by the warder and I suppose punished At least he was not
at exercise on Monday though I think I caught sight of him at the
corner of the stoneyard walking in charge of a warder

On the Tuesdaymy last day in prisonI saw him at exercise He was
worse than before and again was sent in Since then I know nothing of
him but I found out from one of the prisoners who walked with me at
exercise that he had had twentyfour lashes in the cookhouse on
Saturday afternoon by order of the visiting justices on the report of
the doctor The howls that had horrified us all were his

This man is undoubtedly becoming insane Prison doctors have no
knowledge of mental disease of any kind They are as a class ignorant
men The pathology of the mind is unknown to them When a man grows
insane they treat him as shamming They have him punished again and
again Naturally the man becomes worse When ordinary punishments are
exhausted the doctor reports the case to the justices The result is
flogging Of course the flogging is not done with a catofninetails
It is what is called birching The instrument is a rod but the result
on the wretched halfwitted man may be imagined

His number is or was A   I also managed to find out his name It
is Prince Something should be done at once for him He is a soldier
and his sentence is one of courtmartial The term is six months Three
have yet to run

May I ask you to use your influence to have this case examined into and
to see that the lunatic prisoner is properly treated

No report by the Medical Commissioners is of any avail It is not to be
trusted The medical inspectors do not seem to understand the difference
between idiocy and lunacybetween the entire absence of a function or
organ and the diseases of a function or organ This man A   will
I have no doubt be able to tell his name the nature of his offence
the day of the month the date of the beginning and expiration of his
sentence and answer any ordinary simple question but that his mind is
diseased admits of no doubt At present it is a horrible duel between
himself and the doctor The doctor is fighting for a theory The man is
fighting for his life I am anxious that the man should win But let the
whole case be examined into by experts who understand braindisease and
by people of humane feelings who have still some commonsense and some
pity There is no reason that the sentimentalist should be asked to
interfere He always does harm He culminates at his starting point His
end as his origin is an emotion

The case is a special instance of the cruelty inseparable from a stupid
system for the present Governor of Reading is a man of gentle and
humane character greatly liked and respected by all the prisoners He
was appointed in July last and though he cannot alter the rules of the
prison system he has altered the spirit in which they used to be
carried out under his predecessor He is very popular with the prisoners
and with the warders Indeed he has quite elevated the whole tone of the
prisonlife Upon the other hand the system is of course beyond his
reach as far as altering its rules is concerned I have no doubt that he
sees daily much of what he knows to be unjust stupid and cruel But
his hands are tied Of course I have no knowledge of his real views of
the case of A   nor indeed of any of his views on our present
system I merely judge him by the complete change he brought about in
Reading Prison Under his predecessor the system was carried out with
the greatest harshness and stupidityI remain Sir your obedient
servant
