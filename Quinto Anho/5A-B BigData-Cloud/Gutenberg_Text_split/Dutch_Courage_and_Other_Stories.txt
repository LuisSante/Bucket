PREFACE


Ive never written a line that Id be ashamed for my young daughters to
read and I never shall write such a line

Thus Jack London well along in his career And thus almost any
collection of his adventure stories is acceptable to young readers as
well as to their elders So in sorting over the few manuscripts still
unpublished in book form while most of them were written primarily for
boys and girls I do not hesitate to include as appropriate a tale such
as Whose Business Is to Live

Number two of the present group Typhoon Off the Coast of Japan is
the first story ever written by Jack London for publication At the age
of seventeen he had returned from his deepwater voyage in the sealing
schooner Sophie Sutherland and was working thirteen hours a day
for forty dollars a month in an Oakland California jute mill The
San Francisco Call offered a prize of twentyfive dollars for the
best written descriptive article Jacks mother Flora London
remembering that I had excelled in his school compositions urged him
to enter the contest by recalling some happening of his travels Grammar
school years earlier had been his sole disciplined education But his
wide reading worldly experience and extraordinary powers of
observation and correlation enabled him to command first prize It is
notable that the second and third awards went to students at California
and Stanford universities

Jack never took the trouble to hunt up that old San Francisco
Call of November   but when I came to write his biography
The Book of Jack London I unearthed the issue and the tale appears
intact in my English edition published in  And now gathering
material for what will be the final Jack London collections I cannot
but think that his first printed story will have unusual interest for
his readers of all ages

The boy Jacks unexpected success in that virgin venture naturally
spurred him to further effort It was for one thing the pleasantest
way he had ever earned so much money even if it lacked the element of
physical prowess and danger that had marked those purple days with the
oyster pirates and later equally exciting passages with the Fish
Patrol He only waited to catch up on sleep lost while hammering out
Typhoon Off the Coast of Japan before applying himself to new
fiction That was what was the matter with it it was sheer fiction in
place of the whitehot realism of the true story that had brought him
distinction This second venture he afterward termed gush It was
promptly rejected by the editor of the Call Lacking experience
in such matters Jack could not know why And it did not occur to him to
submit his manuscript elsewhere His fire was dampened he gave over
writing and continued with the jute mill and innocent social diversion
in company with Louis Shattuck and his friends who had superseded
Jacks wilder comrades and hazards of bay and seafaring This period
following the publication of Typhoon Off the Coast of Japan is
touched upon in his book John Barleycorn

The next that one hears of attempts at writing is when during his
tramping episode he showed some stories to his aunt Mrs Everhard in
St Joseph Michigan And in the ensuing months of that year  she
received other romances mailed at his stopping places along the eastward
route alone or with Kellys Industrial Army As yet it had not sunk
into his consciousness that his unyouthful knowledge of life in the raw
would be the means of success in literature therefore he discoursed of
imaginary things and persons lords and ladies days of chivalry and
what notanything but out of his priceless firsthand lore At the same
time however he kept a small diary which in the days when he had
found himself helped in visualizing his tramp life in The Road

The only out and out juvenile in the Jack London list prior to his
death is The Cruise of the Dazzler published in  At that it is a
good and authentic maritime study of its kind and not lacking in honest
thrills Tales of the Fish Patrol comes next as a book for boys but
the happenings told therein are perilous enough to interest many an
older reader

I am often asked which of his books have made the strongest appeal to
youth The impulse is to answer that it depends upon the particular type
of youth As example there lies before me a letter from a friend Ruth
she is eleven has been reading every book of your husbands that she
can get hold of She is crazy over the stories I have bought nearly all
of them but cannot find The Son of the Wolf Moon Face and
Michael Brother of Jerry Will you tell me where I can order these I
have not yet learned Ruths favorites but I smile to myself at thought
of the rereading she may have to do when her mind has more fully
developed

The youth of every country who read Jack London naturally turn to his
adventure storiesparticularly The Call of the Wild and its companion
White Fang The Sea Wolf The Cruise of the Snark and my own
journal The Log of the Snark and Our Hawaii Smoke Bellew Tales
Adventure The Mutiny of the Elsinore as well as Before Adam
The Game The Abysmal Brute The Road Jerry of the Islands and
its sequel Michael Brother of Jerry And because of the last named
the youth of many lands are enrolling in the famous Jack London Club
This was inspired by Dr Francis H Bowley President of the
Massachusetts SPCA The Club expects no dues Membership is automatic
through the mere promise to leave any playhouse during an animal
performance The protest thereby registered is bound in good time to
do away with the abuses that attend animal training for show purposes
Michael Brother of Jerry was written out of Jack Londons heart of
love and head of understanding of animals aided by a yearslong study
of the conditions of which he treats Incidentally this book contains
one of the most charming bits of seafaring romance of the Southern Ocean
that he ever wrote

During the Great War the English speaking soldiers called freely for
the foregoing novels dubbing them The Jacklondons and there was also
lively demand for Burning Daylight The Scarlet Plague The Star
Rover The Little Lady of the Big House The Valley of the Moon
and because of its prophetic spirit The Iron Heel There was
likewise a desire for the shortstory collections such as The God of
His Fathers Children of the Frost The Faith of Men Love of
Life Lost Face When God Laughs and later groups like South Sea
Tales A Son of the Sun The Night Born and The House of Pride
and a long list beside

But for the serious minded youth of America Great Britain and all
countries where Jack Londons work has been translatedyouth
considering life with a purposeMartin Eden is the beacon Passing
years only augment the number of messages that find their way to me from
near and far attesting the worth to thoughtful boys and girls young
men and women of the authors own formative struggle in life and
letters as partially outlined in Martin Eden

The present sheaf of young folks stories were written during the latter
part of that battle for recognition and my gathering of them inside
book covers is pursuant of his own intention at the time of his death on
November

DUTCH COURAGE


Just our luck

Gus Lafee finished wiping his hands and sullenly threw the towel upon
the rocks His attitude was one of deep dejection The light seemed gone
out of the day and the glory from the golden sun Even the keen mountain
air was devoid of relish and the early morning no longer yielded its
customary zest

Just our luck Gus repeated this time avowedly for the edification of
another young fellow who was busily engaged in sousing his head in the
water of the lake

What are you grumbling about anyway Hazard Van Dorn lifted a
soaprimmed face questioningly His eyes were shut Whats our luck

Look there Gus threw a moody glance skyward Some duffers got ahead
of us Weve been scooped thats all

Hazard opened his eyes and caught a fleeting glimpse of a white flag
waving arrogantly on the edge of a wall of rock nearly a mile above his
head Then his eyes closed with a snap and his face wrinkled
spasmodically Gus threw him the towel and uncommiseratingly watched
him wipe out the offending soap He felt too blue himself to take stock
in trivialities

Hazard groaned

Does it hurtmuch Gus queried coldly without interest as if it
were no more than his duty to ask after the welfare of his comrade

I guess it does responded the suffering one

Soaps pretty strong ehNoticed it myself

Tisnt the soap Itsits that He opened his reddened eyes
and pointed toward the innocent white little flag Thats what hurts

Gus Lafee did not reply but turned away to start the fire and begin
cooking breakfast His disappointment and grief were too deep for
anything but silence and Hazard who felt likewise never opened his
mouth as he fed the horses nor once laid his head against their arching
necks or passed caressing fingers through their manes The two boys were
blind also to the manifold glories of Mirror Lake which reposed at
their very feet Nine times had they chosen to move along its margin
the short distance of a hundred yards could they have seen the sunrise
repeated nine times from behind as many successive peaks could they
have seen the great orb rear his blazing rim and nine times had they
but looked into the waters of the lake could they have seen the
phenomena reflected faithfully and vividly But all the Titanic grandeur
of the scene was lost to them They had been robbed of the chief
pleasure of their trip to Yosemite Valley They had been frustrated in
their longcherished design upon Half Dome and hence were rendered
disconsolate and blind to the beauties and the wonders of the place

Half Dome rears its icescarred head fully five thousand feet above the
level floor of Yosemite Valley In the name itself of this great rock
lies an accurate and complete description Nothing more nor less is it
than a cyclopean rounded dome split in half as cleanly as an apple
that is divided by a knife It is perhaps quite needless to state that
but onehalf remains hence its name the other half having been carried
away by the great iceriver in the stormy time of the Glacial Period In
that dim day one of those frigid rivers gouged a mighty channel from out
the solid rock This channel today is Yosemite Valley But to return to
the Half Dome On its northeastern side by circuitous trails and stiff
climbing one may gain the Saddle Against the slope of the Dome the
Saddle leans like a gigantic slab and from the top of this slab one
thousand feet in length curves the great circle to the summit of the
Dome A few degrees too steep for unaided climbing these one thousand
feet defied for years the adventurous spirits who fixed yearning eyes
upon the crest above

One day a couple of clearheaded mountaineers had proceeded to insert
iron eyebolts into holes which they drilled into the rock every few
feet apart But when they found themselves three hundred feet above the
Saddle clinging like flies to the precarious wall with on either hand a
yawning abyss their nerves failed them and they abandoned the
enterprise So it remained for an indomitable Scotchman one George
Anderson finally to achieve the feat Beginning where they had left
off drilling and climbing for a week he had at last set foot upon that
awful summit and gazed down into the depths where Mirror Lake reposed
nearly a mile beneath

In the years which followed many bold men took advantage of the huge
rope ladder which he had put in place but one winter ladder cables and
all were carried away by the snow and ice True most of the eyebolts
twisted and bent remained But few men had since essayed the hazardous
undertaking and of those few more than one gave up his life on the
treacherous heights and not one succeeded

But Gus Lafee and Hazard Van Dorn had left the smiling valleyland of
California and journeyed into the high Sierras intent on the great
adventure And thus it was that their disappointment was deep and
grievous when they awoke on this morning to receive the forestalling
message of the little white flag

Camped at the foot of the Saddle last night and went up at the first
peep of day Hazard ventured long after the silent breakfast had been
tucked away and the dishes washed

Gus nodded It was not in the nature of things that a youths spirits
should long remain at low ebb and his tongue was beginning to loosen

Guess hes down by now lying in camp and feeling as big as Alexander
the other went on And I dont blame him either only I wish it were
we

You can be sure hes down Gus spoke up at last Its mighty warm on
that naked rock with the sun beating down on it at this time of year
That was our plan you know to go up early and come down early And any
man sensible enough to get to the top is bound to have sense enough to
do it before the rock gets hot and his hands sweaty

And you can be sure he didnt take his shoes with him Hazard rolled
over on his back and lazily regarded the speck of flag fluttering
briskly on the sheer edge of the precipice Say He sat up with a
start Whats that

A metallic ray of light flashed out from the summit of Half Dome then a
second and a third The heads of both boys were craned backward on the
instant agog with excitement

What a duffer Gus cried Why didnt he come down when it was cool

Hazard shook his head slowly as if the question were too deep for
immediate answer and they had better defer judgment

The flashes continued and as the boys soon noted at irregular
intervals of duration and disappearance Now they were long now short
and again they came and went with great rapidity or ceased altogether
for several moments at a time

I have it Hazards face lighted up with the coming of understanding
I have it That fellow up there is trying to talk to us Hes flashing
the sunlight down to us on a pocketmirrordot dash dot dash dont
you see

The light also began to break in Guss face Ah I know Its what they
do in wartimesignaling They call it heliographing dont they Same
thing as telegraphing only its done without wires And they use the
same dots and dashes too

Yes the Morse alphabet Wish I knew it

Same here He surely must have something to say to us or he wouldnt
be kicking up all that rumpus

Still the flashes came and went persistently till Gus exclaimed That
chaps in trouble thats whats the matter with him Most likely hes
hurt himself or something or other

Go on Hazard scouted

Gus got out the shotgun and fired both barrels three times in rapid
succession A perfect flutter of flashes came back before the echoes had
ceased their antics So unmistakable was the message that even doubting
Hazard was convinced that the man who had forestalled them stood in some
grave danger

Quick Gus he cried and pack Ill see to the horses Our trip
hasnt come to nothing after all Weve got to go right up Half Dome
and rescue him Wheres the map How do we get to the Saddle

Taking the horsetrail below the Vernal Falls Gus read from the
guidebook one mile of brisk traveling brings the tourist to the
worldfamed Nevada Fall Close by rising up in all its pomp and glory
the Cap of Liberty stands guard

Skip all that Hazard impatiently interrupted The trails what we
want

Oh here it is Following the trail up the side of the fall will bring
you to the forks The left one leads to Little Yosemite Valley Clouds
Rest and other points

Hold on thatll do Ive got it on the map now again interrupted
Hazard From the Clouds Rest trail a dotted line leads off to Half
Dome That shows the trails abandoned Well have to look sharp to find
it Its a days journey

And to think of all that traveling when right here were at the bottom
of the Dome Gus complained staring up wistfully at the goal

Thats because this is Yosemite and all the more reason for us to
hurry Come on Be lively now

Well used as they were to trail life but few minutes sufficed to see
the camp equipage on the backs of the packhorses and the boys in the
saddle In the late twilight of that evening they hobbled their animals
in a tiny mountain meadow and cooked coffee and bacon for themselves at
the very base of the Saddle Here also before they turned into their
blankets they found the camp of the unlucky stranger who was destined
to spend the night on the naked roof of the Dome

Dawn was brightening into day when the panting lads threw themselves
down at the summit of the Saddle and began taking off their shoes
Looking down from the great height they seemed perched upon the
ridgepole of the world and even the snowcrowned Sierra peaks seemed
beneath them Directly below on the one hand lay Little Yosemite
Valley half a mile deep on the other hand Big Yosemite a mile
Already the suns rays were striking about the adventurers but the
darkness of night still shrouded the two great gulfs into which they
peered And above them bathed in the full day rose only the majestic
curve of the Dome

Whats that for Gus asked pointing to a leathershielded flask which
Hazard was securely fastening in his shirt pocket

Dutch courage of course was the reply Well need all our nerve in
this undertaking and a little bit more and he tapped the flask
significantly heres the little bit more

Good idea Gus commented

How they had ever come possessed of this erroneous idea it would be
hard to discover but they were young yet and there remained for them
many uncut pages of life Believers also in the efficacy of whisky as
a remedy for snakebite they had brought with them a fair supply of
medicinechest liquor As yet they had not touched it

Have some before we start Hazard asked

Gus looked into the gulf and shook his head Better wait till we get up
higher and the climbing is more ticklish

Some seventy feet above them projected the first eyebolt The winter
accumulations of ice had twisted and bent it down till it did not stand
more than a bare inch and a half above the rocka most difficult object
to lasso as such a distance Time and again Hazard coiled his lariat in
true cowboy fashion and made the cast and time and again was he baffled
by the elusive peg Nor could Gus do better Taking advantage of
inequalities in the surface they scrambled twenty feet up the Dome and
found they could rest in a shallow crevice The cleft side of the Dome
was so near that they could look over its edge from the crevice and gaze
down the smooth vertical wall for nearly two thousand feet It was yet
too dark down below for them to see farther

The peg was now fifty feet away but the path they must cover to
get to it was quite smooth and ran at an inclination of nearly fifty
degrees It seemed impossible in that intervening space to find a
restingplace Either the climber must keep going up or he must slide
down he could not stop But just here rose the danger The Dome was
sphereshaped and if he should begin to slide his course would be not
to the point from which he had started and where the Saddle would catch
him but off to the south toward Little Yosemite This meant a plunge of
half a mile

Ill try it Gus said simply

They knotted the two lariats together so that they had over a hundred
feet of rope between them and then each boy tied an end to his waist

If I slide Gus cautioned come in on the slack and brace yourself
If you dont youll follow me thats all

Ay ay was the confident response Better take a nip before you
start

Gus glanced at the proffered bottle He knew himself and of what he was
capable Wait till I make the peg and you join me All ready

Ay

He struck out like a cat on all fours clawing energetically as he
urged his upward progress his comrade paying out the rope carefully At
first his speed was good but gradually it dwindled Now he was fifteen
feet from the peg now ten now eightbut going oh so slowly Hazard
looking up from his crevice felt a contempt for him and disappointment
in him It did look easy Now Gus was five feet away and after a
painful effort four feet But when only a yard intervened he came to a
standstillnot exactly a standstill for like a squirrel in a wheel
he maintained his position on the face of the Dome by the most desperate
clawing

He had failed that was evident The question now was how to save
himself With a sudden catlike movement he whirled over on his back
caught his heel in a tiny saucershaped depression and sat up Then his
courage failed him Day had at last penetrated to the floor of the
valley and he was appalled at the frightful distance

Go ahead and make it Hazard ordered but Gus merely shook his head

Then come down

Again he shook his head This was his ordeal to sit nerveless and
insecure on the brink of the precipice But Hazard lying safely in his
crevice now had to face his own ordeal but one of a different nature
When Gus began to slideas he soon mustwould he Hazard be able to
take in the slack and then meet the shock as the other tautened the rope
and darted toward the plunge It seemed doubtful And there he lay
apparently safe but in reality harnessed to death Then rose the
temptation Why not cast off the rope about his waist He would be safe
at all events It was a simple way out of the difficulty There was no
need that two should perish But it was impossible for such temptation
to overcome his pride of race and his own pride in himself and in his
honor So the rope remained about him

Come down he ordered but Gus seemed to have become petrified

Come down he threatened or Ill drag you down He pulled on the
rope to show he was in earnest

Dont you dare Gus articulated through his clenched teeth

Sure I will if you dont come Again he jerked the rope

With a despairing gurgle Gus started doing his best to work sideways
from the plunge Hazard every sense on the alert almost exulting in
his perfect coolness took in the slack with deft rapidity Then as the
rope began to tighten he braced himself The shock drew him half out of
the crevice but he held firm and served as the center of the circle
while Gus with the rope as a radius described the circumference and
ended up on the extreme southern edge of the Saddle A few moments later
Hazard was offering him the flask

Take some yourself Gus said

No you I dont need it

And Im past needing it Evidently Gus was dubious of the bottle and
its contents

Hazard put it away in his pocket Are you game he asked or are you
going to give it up

Never Gus protested I am game No Lafee ever showed the
white feather yet And if I did lose my grit up there it was only for
the momentsort of like seasickness Im all right now and Im going
to the top

Good encouraged Hazard You lie in the crevice this time and Ill
show you how easy it is

But Gus refused He held that it was easier and safer for him to try
again arguing that it was less difficult for his one hundred and
sixteen pounds to cling to the smooth rock than for Hazards one hundred
and sixtyfive also that it was easier for one hundred and sixtyfive
pounds to bring a sliding one hundred and sixteen to a stop than vice
versa And further that he had the benefit of his previous
experience Hazard saw the justice of this although it was with great
reluctance that he gave in

Success vindicated Guss contention The second time just as it seemed
as if his slide would be repeated he made a last supreme effort and
gripped the coveted peg By means of the rope Hazard quickly joined
him The next peg was nearly sixty feet away but for nearly half that
distance the base of some glacier in the forgotten past had ground a
shallow furrow Taking advantage of this it was easy for Gus to lasso
the eyebolt And it seemed as was really the case that the hardest
part of the task was over True the curve steepened to nearly sixty
degrees above them but a comparatively unbroken line of eyebolts six
feet apart awaited the lads They no longer had even to use the lasso
Standing on one peg it was childs play to throw the bight of the rope
over the next and to draw themselves up to it

A bronzed and bearded man met them at the top and gripped their hands in
hearty fellowship

Talk about your Mont Blancs he exclaimed pausing in the midst of
greeting them to survey the mighty panorama But theres nothing on all
the earth nor over it nor under it to compare with this Then he
recollected himself and thanked them for coming to his aid No he was
not hurt or injured in any way Simply because of his own carelessness
just as he had arrived at the top the previous day he had dropped his
climbing rope Of course it was impossible to descend without it Did
they understand heliographing No That was strange How did they

Oh we knew something was the matter Gus interrupted from the way
you flashed when we fired off the shotgun

Find it pretty cold last night without blankets Hazard queried

I should say so Ive hardly thawed out yet

Have some of this Hazard shoved the flask over to him

The stranger regarded him quite seriously for a moment then said
My dear fellow do you see that row of pegs Since it is my honest
intention to climb down them very shortly I am forced to decline
No I dont think Ill have any though I thank you just the same

Hazard glanced at Gus and then put the flask back in his pocket But
when they pulled the doubled rope through the last eyebolt and set foot
on the Saddle he again drew out the bottle

Now that were down we dont need it he remarked pithily And Ive
about come to the conclusion that there isnt very much in Dutch
courage after all He gazed up the great curve of the Dome Look at
what weve done without it

Several seconds thereafter a party of tourists gathered at the margin
of Mirror Lake were astounded at the unwonted phenomenon of a whisky
flask descending upon them like a comet out of a clear sky and all the
way back to the hotel they marveled greatly at the wonders of nature
especially meteorites




TYPHOON OFF THE COAST OF JAPAN

Jack Londons first story published at the age of seventeen


It was four bells in the morning watch We had just finished breakfast
when the order came forward for the watch on deck to stand by to heave
her to and all hands stand by the boats

Port hard a port cried our sailingmaster Clew up the topsails
Let the flying jib run down Back the jib over to windward and run down
the foresail And so was our schooner Sophie Sutherland hove to
off the Japan coast near Cape Jerimo on April  

Then came moments of bustle and confusion There were eighteen men to
man the six boats Some were hooking on the falls others casting off
the lashings boatsteerers appeared with boatcompasses and
waterbreakers and boatpullers with the lunch boxes Hunters were
staggering under two or three shotguns a rifle and heavy ammunition
box all of which were soon stowed away with their oilskins and mittens
in the boats

The sailingmaster gave his last orders and away we went pulling three
pairs of oars to gain our positions We were in the weather boat and so
had a longer pull than the others The first second and third lee
boats soon had all sail set and were running off to the southward and
westward with the wind beam while the schooner was running off to
leeward of them so that in case of accident the boats would have fair
wind home

It was a glorious morning but our boatsteerer shook his head ominously
as he glanced at the rising sun and prophetically muttered Red sun in
the morning sailor take warning The sun had an angry look and a few
light fleecy niggerheads in that quarter seemed abashed and
frightened and soon disappeared

Away off to the northward Cape Jerimo reared its black forbidding head
like some huge monster rising from the deep The winters snow not yet
entirely dissipated by the sun covered it in patches of glistening
white over which the light wind swept on its way out to sea Huge gulls
rose slowly fluttering their wings in the light breeze and striking
their webbed feet on the surface of the water for over half a mile
before they could leave it Hardly had the patter patter died away
when a flock of sea quail rose and with whistling wings flew away
to windward where members of a large band of whales were disporting
themselves their blowings sounding like the exhaust of steam engines
The harsh discordant cries of a seaparrot grated unpleasantly on the
ear and set half a dozen alert in a small band of seals that were ahead
of us Away they went breaching and jumping entirely out of water A
seagull with slow deliberate flight and long majestic curves circled
round us and as a reminder of home a little English sparrow perched
impudently on the focastle head and cocking his head on one side
chirped merrily The boats were soon among the seals and the bang
bang of the guns could be heard from down to leeward

The wind was slowly rising and by three oclock as with a dozen seals
in our boat we were deliberating whether to go on or turn back the
recall flag was run up at the schooners mizzena sure sign that with
the rising wind the barometer was falling and that our sailingmaster
was getting anxious for the welfare of the boats

Away we went before the wind with a single reef in our sail With
clenched teeth sat the boatsteerer grasping the steering oar firmly
with both hands his restless eyes on the alerta glance at the
schooner ahead as we rose on a sea another at the mainsheet and then
one astern where the dark ripple of the wind on the water told him of a
coming puff or a large whitecap that threatened to overwhelm us The
waves were holding high carnival performing the strangest antics as
with wild glee they danced along in fierce pursuitnow up now down
here there and everywhere until some great sea of liquid green with
its milkwhite crest of foam rose from the oceans throbbing bosom and
drove the others from view But only for a moment for again under new
forms they reappeared In the suns path they wandered where every
ripple great or small every little spit or spray looked like molten
silver where the water lost its dark green color and became a dazzling
silvery flood only to vanish and become a wild waste of sullen
turbulence each dark foreboding sea rising and breaking then rolling
on again The dash the sparkle the silvery light soon vanished with
the sun which became obscured by black clouds that were rolling swiftly
in from the west northwest apt heralds of the coming storm

We soon reached the schooner and found ourselves the last aboard
In a few minutes the seals were skinned boats and decks washed and
we were down below by the roaring focastle fire with a wash change
of clothes and a hot substantial supper before us Sail had been put
on the schooner as we had a run of seventyfive miles to make to the
southward before morning so as to get in the midst of the seals out
of which we had strayed during the last two days hunting

We had the first watch from eight to midnight The wind was soon blowing
half a gale and our sailingmaster expected little sleep that night as
he paced up and down the poop The topsails were soon clewed up and made
fast then the flying jib run down and furled Quite a sea was rolling
by this time occasionally breaking over the decks flooding them and
threatening to smash the boats At six bells we were ordered to turn
them over and put on storm lashings This occupied us till eight bells
when we were relieved by the midwatch I was the last to go below
doing so just as the watch on deck was furling the spanker Below all
were asleep except our green hand the bricklayer who was dying of
consumption The wildly dancing movements of the sea lamp cast a pale
flickering light through the focastle and turned to golden honey the
drops of water on the yellow oilskins In all the corners dark shadows
seemed to come and go while up in the eyes of her beyond the pall
bits descending from deck to deck where they seemed to lurk like some
dragon at the caverns mouth it was dark as Erebus Now and again the
light seemed to penetrate for a moment as the schooner rolled heavier
than usual only to recede leaving it darker and blacker than before
The roar of the wind through the rigging came to the ear muffled like
the distant rumble of a train crossing a trestle or the surf on the
beach while the loud crash of the seas on her weather bow seemed almost
to rend the beams and planking asunder as it resounded through the
focastle The creaking and groaning of the timbers stanchions and
bulkheads as the strain the vessel was undergoing was felt served to
drown the groans of the dying man as he tossed uneasily in his bunk
The working of the foremast against the deck beams caused a shower of
flaky powder to fall and sent another sound mingling with the tumultous
storm Small cascades of water streamed from the pall bits from the
focastle head above and joining issue with the streams from the wet
oilskins ran along the floor and disappeared aft into the main hold

At two bells in the middle watchthat is in land parlance one oclock
in the morningthe order was roared out on the focastle All hands on
deck and shorten sail

Then the sleepy sailors tumbled out of their bunk and into their
clothes oilskins and seaboots and up on deck Tis when that order
comes on cold blustering nights that Jack grimly mutters Who would
not sell a farm and go to sea

It was on deck that the force of the wind could be fully appreciated
especially after leaving the stifling focastle It seemed to stand
up against you like a wall making it almost impossible to move on
the heaving decks or to breathe as the fierce gusts came dashing by
The schooner was hove to under jib foresail and mainsail We proceeded
to lower the foresail and make it fast The night was dark greatly
impeding our labor Still though not a star or the moon could pierce
the black masses of storm clouds that obscured the sky as they swept
along before the gale nature aided us in a measure A soft light
emanated from the movement of the ocean Each mighty sea all
phosphorescent and glowing with the tiny lights of myriads of
animalcul threatened to overwhelm us with a deluge of fire Higher and
higher thinner and thinner the crest grew as it began to curve and
overtop preparatory to breaking until with a roar it fell over the
bulwarks a mass of soft glowing light and tons of water which sent the
sailors sprawling in all directions and left in each nook and cranny
little specks of light that glowed and trembled till the next sea washed
them away depositing new ones in their places Sometimes several seas
following each other with great rapidity and thundering down on our
decks filled them full to the bulwarks but soon they were discharged
through the lee scuppers

To reef the mainsail we were forced to run off before the gale under the
single reefed jib By the time we had finished the wind had forced up
such a tremendous sea that it was impossible to heave her to Away we
flew on the wings of the storm through the muck and flying spray A wind
sheer to starboard then another to port as the enormous seas struck the
schooner astern and nearly broached her to As day broke we took in the
jib leaving not a sail unfurled Since we had begun scudding she had
ceased to take the seas over her bow but amidships they broke fast
and furious It was a dry storm in the matter of rain but the force
of the wind filled the air with fine spray which flew as high as the
crosstrees and cut the face like a knife making it impossible to see
over a hundred yards ahead The sea was a dark lead color as with long
slow majestic roll it was heaped up by the wind into liquid mountains
of foam The wild antics of the schooner were sickening as she forged
along She would almost stop as though climbing a mountain then
rapidly rolling to right and left as she gained the summit of a huge
sea she steadied herself and paused for a moment as though affrighted
at the yawning precipice before her Like an avalanche she shot forward
and down as the sea astern struck her with the force of a thousand
battering rams burying her bow to the catheads in the milky foam at the
bottom that came on deck in all directionsforward astern to right
and left through the hawsepipes and over the rail

The wind began to drop and by ten oclock we were talking of heaving
her to We passed a ship two schooners and a fourmasted barkentine
under the smallest of canvas and at eleven oclock running up the
spanker and jib we hove her to and in another hour we were beating
back again against the aftersea under full sail to regain the sealing
ground away to the westward

Below a couple of men were sewing the bricklayers body in canvas
preparatory to the sea burial And so with the storm passed away the
bricklayers soul




THE LOST POACHER


But they wont take excuses Youre across the line and thats enough
Theyll take you In you go Siberia and the saltmines And as for
Uncle Sam why whats he to know about it Never a word will get back
to the States The Mary Thomas the papers will say the
Mary Thomas lost with all hands Probably in a typhoon in the
Japanese seas Thats what the papers will say and people too In you
go Siberia and the saltmines Dead to the world and kith and kin
though you live fifty years

In such manner John Lewis commonly known as the sealawyer settled
the matter out of hand

It was a serious moment in the forecastle of the Mary Thomas No
sooner had the watch below begun to talk the trouble over than the
watch on deck came down and joined them As there was no wind every
hand could be spared with the exception of the man at the wheel and he
remained only for the sake of discipline Even Bub Russell the
cabinboy had crept forward to hear what was going on

However it was a serious moment as the grave faces of the sailors bore
witness For the three preceding months the Mary Thomas sealing
schooner had hunted the seal pack along the coast of Japan and north to
Bering Sea Here on the Asiatic side of the sea they were forced to
give over the chase or rather to go no farther for beyond the
Russian cruisers patrolled forbidden ground where the seals might breed
in peace

A week before she had fallen into a heavy fog accompanied by calm Since
then the fogbank had not lifted and the only wind had been light airs
and catspaws This in itself was not so bad for the sealing schooners
are never in a hurry so long as they are in the midst of the seals but
the trouble lay in the fact that the current at this point bore heavily
to the north Thus the Mary Thomas had unwittingly drifted across
the line and every hour she was penetrating unwillingly farther and
farther into the dangerous waters where the Russian bear kept guard

How far she had drifted no man knew The sun had not been visible
for a week nor the stars and the captain had been unable to take
observations in order to determine his position At any moment a cruiser
might swoop down and hale the crew away to Siberia The fate of other
poaching sealhunters was too well known to the men of the Mary
Thomas and there was cause for grave faces

Mine friends spoke up a German boatsteerer it vas a pad piziness
Shust as ve make a big catch und all honest somedings go wrong und
der Russians nab us dake our skins and our schooner und send us mit
der anarchists to Siberia Ach a pretty pad piziness

Yes thats where it hurts the sea lawyer went on Fifteen hundred
skins in the salt piles and all honest a big payday coming to every
man Jack of us and then to be captured and lose it all Itd be
different if wed been poaching but its all honest work in open
water

But if we havent done anything wrong they cant do anything to us
can they Bub queried

It strikes me as ow it aint the proper thing for a boy o your age
shovin in when is elders is talkin protested an English sailor
from over the edge of his bunk

Oh thats all right Jack answered the sealawyer Hes a perfect
right to Aint he just as liable to lose his wages as the rest of us

Wouldnt give thruppence for them Jack sniffed back He had been
planning to go home and see his family in Chelsea when he was paid off
and he was now feeling rather blue over the highly possible loss not
only of his pay but of his liberty

How are they to know the sealawyer asked in answer to Bubs previous
question Here we are in forbidden water How do they know but what we
came here of our own accord Here we are fifteen hundred skins in the
hold How do they know whether we got them in open water or in the
closed sea Dont you see Bub the evidence is all against us If you
caught a man with his pockets full of apples like those which grow on
your tree and if you caught him in your tree besides whatd you think
if he told you he couldnt help it and had just been sort of blown
there and that anyway those apples came from some other treewhatd
you think eh

Bub saw it clearly when put in that light and shook his head
despondently

Youd rather be dead than go to Siberia one of the boatpullers said
They put you into the saltmines and work you till you die Never see
daylight again Why Ive heard tell of one fellow that was chained to
his mate and that mate died And they were both chained together And
if they send you to the quicksilver mines you get salivated Id rather
be hung than salivated

Wots salivated Jack asked suddenly sitting up in his bunk at the
hint of fresh misfortunes

Why the quicksilver gets into your blood I think thats the way And
your gums all swell like you had the scurvy only worse and your teeth
get loose in your jaws And big ulcers form and then you die horrible
The strongest man cant last long amining quicksilver

A pad piziness the boatsteerer reiterated dolorously in the
silence which followed A pad piziness I vish I was in Yokohama Eh
Vot vas dot

The vessel had suddenly heeled over The decks were aslant A tin
pannikin rolled down the inclined plane rattling and banging From
above came the slapping of canvas and the quivering rattattat of the
after leech of the loosely stretched foresail Then the mates voice
sang down the hatch All hands on deck and make sail

Never had such summons been answered with more enthusiasm The calm had
broken The wind had come which was to carry them south into safety
With a wild cheer all sprang on deck Working with mad haste they flung
out topsails flying jibs and staysails As they worked the fogbank
lifted and the black vault of heaven bespangled with the old familiar
stars rushed into view When all was shipshape the Mary Thomas
was lying gallantly over on her side to a beam wind and plunging ahead
due south

Steamers lights ahead on the port bow sir cried the lookout from
his station on the forecastlehead There was excitement in the mans
voice

The captain sent Bub below for his nightglasses Everybody crowded to
the leerail to gaze at the suspicious stranger which already began to
loom up vague and indistinct In those unfrequented waters the chance
was one in a thousand that it could be anything else than a Russian
patrol The captain was still anxiously gazing through the glasses when
a flash of flame left the strangers side followed by the loud report
of a cannon The worst fears were confirmed It was a patrol evidently
firing across the bows of the Mary Thomas in order to make her
heave to

Hard down with your helm the captain commanded the steersman all
the life gone out of his voice Then to the crew Back over the jib and
foresail Run down the flying jib Clew up the foretopsail And aft here
and swing on to the mainsheet

The Mary Thomas ran into the eye of the wind lost headway and
fell to courtesying gravely to the long seas rolling up from the west

The cruiser steamed a little nearer and lowered a boat The sealers
watched in heartbroken silence They could see the white bulk of the
boat as it was slacked away to the water and its crew sliding aboard
They could hear the creaking of the davits and the commands of the
officers Then the boat sprang away under the impulse of the oars and
came toward them The wind had been rising and already the sea was too
rough to permit the frail craft to lie alongside the tossing schooner
but watching their chance and taking advantage of the boarding ropes
thrown to them an officer and a couple of men clambered aboard
The boat then sheered off into safety and lay to its oars a young
midshipman sitting in the stern and holding the yokelines in charge

The officer whose uniform disclosed his rank as that of second
lieutenant in the Russian navy went below with the captain of the
Mary Thomas to look at the ships papers A few minutes later he
emerged and upon his sailors removing the hatchcovers passed down
into the hold with a lantern to inspect the salt piles It was a goodly
heap which confronted himfifteen hundred fresh skins the seasons
catch and under the circumstances he could have had but one conclusion

I am very sorry he said in broken English to the sealing captain
when he again came on deck but it is my duty in the name of the tsar
to seize your vessel as a poacher caught with fresh skins in the closed
sea The penalty as you may know is confiscation and imprisonment

The captain of the Mary Thomas shrugged his shoulders in seeming
indifference and turned away Although they may restrain all outward
show strong men under unmerited misfortune are sometimes very close
to tears Just then the vision of his little California home and of the
wife and two yellowhaired boys was strong upon him and there was a
strange choking sensation in his throat which made him afraid that if
he attempted to speak he would sob instead

And also there was upon him the duty he owed his men No weakness before
them for he must be a tower of strength to sustain them in misfortune
He had already explained to the second lieutenant and knew the
hopelessness of the situation As the sealawyer had said the evidence
was all against him So he turned aft and fell to pacing up and down
the poop of the vessel over which he was no longer commander

The Russian officer now took temporary charge He ordered more of his
men aboard and had all the canvas clewed up and furled snugly away
While this was being done the boat plied back and forth between the
two vessels passing a heavy hawser which was made fast to the great
towingbitts on the schooners forecastlehead During all this work
the sealers stood about in sullen groups It was madness to think of
resisting with the guns of a manofwar not a biscuittoss away but
they refused to lend a hand preferring instead to maintain a gloomy
silence

Having accomplished his task the lieutenant ordered all but four of his
men back into the boat Then the midshipman a lad of sixteen looking
strangely mature and dignified in his uniform and sword came aboard to
take command of the captured sealer Just as the lieutenant prepared to
depart his eyes chanced to alight upon Bub Without a word of warning
he seized him by the arm and dropped him over the rail into the waiting
boat and then with a parting wave of his hand he followed him

It was only natural that Bub should be frightened at this unexpected
happening All the terrible stories he had heard of the Russians served
to make him fear them and now returned to his mind with double force
To be captured by them was bad enough but to be carried off by them
away from his comrades was a fate of which he had not dreamed

Be a good boy Bub the captain called to him as the boat drew away
from the Mary Thomass side and tell the truth

Aye aye sir he answered bravely enough by all outward appearance
He felt a certain pride of race and was ashamed to be a coward before
these strange enemies these wild Russian bears

Und be politeful the German boatsteerer added his rough voice
lifting across the water like a foghorn

Bub waved his hand in farewell and his mates clustered along the
rail as they answered with a cheering shout He found room in the
sternsheets where he fell to regarding the lieutenant He didnt look
so wild or bearish after allvery much like other men Bub concluded
and the sailors were much the same as all other manofwars men he had
ever known Nevertheless as his feet struck the steel deck of the
cruiser he felt as if he had entered the portals of a prison

For a few minutes he was left unheeded The sailors hoisted the boat up
and swung it in on the davits Then great clouds of black smoke poured
out of the funnels and they were under wayto Siberia Bub could not
help but think He saw the Mary Thomas swing abruptly into line
as she took the pressure from the hawser and her sidelights red and
green rose and fell as she was towed through the sea

Bubs eyes dimmed at the melancholy sight butbut just then the
lieutenant came to take him down to the commander and he straightened
up and set his lips firmly as if this were a very commonplace affair
and he were used to being sent to Siberia every day in the week The
cabin in which the commander sat was like a palace compared to the
humble fittings of the Mary Thomas and the commander himself in
gold lace and dignity was a most august personage quite unlike the
simple man who navigated his schooner on the trail of the seal pack

Bub now quickly learned why he had been brought aboard and in the
prolonged questioning which followed told nothing but the plain truth
The truth was harmless only a lie could have injured his cause He did
not know much except that they had been sealing far to the south in
open water and that when the calm and fog came down upon them being
close to the line they had drifted across Again and again he insisted
that they had not lowered a boat or shot a seal in the week they had
been drifting about in the forbidden sea but the commander chose to
consider all that he said to be a tissue of falsehoods and adopted a
bullying tone in an effort to frighten the boy He threatened and
cajoled by turns but failed in the slightest to shake Bubs statements
and at last ordered him out of his presence

By some oversight Bub was not put in anybodys charge and wandered up
on deck unobserved Sometimes the sailors in passing bent curious
glances upon him but otherwise he was left strictly alone Nor could he
have attracted much attention for he was small the night dark and the
watch on deck intent on its own business Stumbling over the strange
decks he made his way aft where he could look upon the sidelights of
the Mary Thomas following steadily in the rear

For a long while he watched and then lay down in the darkness close to
where the hawser passed over the stern to the captured schooner Once
an officer came up and examined the straining rope to see if it were
chafing but Bub cowered away in the shadow undiscovered This however
gave him an idea which concerned the lives and liberties of twentytwo
men and which was to avert crushing sorrow from more than one happy
home many thousand miles away

In the first place he reasoned the crew were all guiltless of any
crime and yet were being carried relentlessly away to imprisonment in
Siberiaa living death he had heard and he believed it implicitly
In the second place he was a prisoner hard and fast with no chance
of escape In the third it was possible for the twentytwo men on the
Mary Thomas to escape The only thing which bound them was a
fourinch hawser They dared not cut it at their end for a watch was
sure to be maintained upon it by their Russian captors but at this end
ah at his end

Bub did not stop to reason further Wriggling close to the hawser he
opened his jackknife and went to work The blade was not very sharp
and he sawed away ropeyarn by ropeyarn the awful picture of the
solitary Siberian exile he must endure growing clearer and more terrible
at every stroke Such a fate was bad enough to undergo with ones
comrades but to face it alone seemed frightful And besides the very
act he was performing was sure to bring greater punishment upon him

In the midst of such somber thoughts he heard footsteps approaching
He wriggled away into the shadow An officer stopped where he had been
working halfstooped to examine the hawser then changed his mind and
straightened up For a few minutes he stood there gazing at the lights
of the captured schooner and then went forward again

Now was the time Bub crept back and went on sawing Now two parts were
severed Now three But one remained The tension upon this was so great
that it readily yielded Splash The freed end went overboard He lay
quietly his heart in his mouth listening No one on the cruiser but
himself had heard

He saw the red and green lights of the Mary Thomas grow dimmer
and dimmer Then a faint hallo came over the water from the Russian
prize crew Still nobody heard The smoke continued to pour out of the
cruisers funnels and her propellers throbbed as mightily as ever

What was happening on the Mary Thomas Bub could only surmise
but of one thing he was certain his comrades would assert themselves
and overpower the four sailors and the midshipman A few minutes later
he saw a small flash and straining his ears heard the very faint report
of a pistol Then oh joy both the red and green lights suddenly
disappeared The Mary Thomas was retaken

Just as an officer came aft Bub crept forward and hid away in
one of the boats Not an instant too soon The alarm was given Loud
voices rose in command The cruiser altered her course An electric
searchlight began to throw its white rays across the sea here there
everywhere but in its flashing path no tossing schooner was revealed

Bub went to sleep soon after that nor did he wake till the gray of
dawn The engines were pulsing monotonously and the water splashing
noisily told him the decks were being washed down One sweeping glance
and he saw that they were alone on the expanse of ocean The Mary
Thomas had escaped As he lifted his head a roar of laughter went
up from the sailors Even the officer who ordered him taken below and
locked up could not quite conceal the laughter in his eyes Bub thought
often in the days of confinement which followed that they were not very
angry with him for what he had done

He was not far from right There is a certain innate nobility deep down
in the hearts of all men which forces them to admire a brave act even
if it is performed by an enemy The Russians were in nowise different
from other men True a boy had outwitted them but they could not blame
him and they were sore puzzled as to what to do with him It would
never do to take a little mite like him in to represent all that
remained of the lost poacher

So two weeks later a United States manofwar steaming out of the
Russian port of Vladivostok was signaled by a Russian cruiser A boat
passed between the two ships and a small boy dropped over the rail upon
the deck of the American vessel A week later he was put ashore at
Hakodate and after some telegraphing his fare was paid on the railroad
to Yokohama

From the depot he hurried through the quaint Japanese streets to the
harbor and hired a sampan boatman to put him aboard a certain
vessel whose familiar rigging had quickly caught his eye Her gaskets
were off her sails unfurled she was just starting back to the United
States As he came closer a crowd of sailors sprang upon the forecastle
head and the windlassbars rose and fell as the anchor was torn from
its muddy bottom

Yankee ship come down the ribber the sealawyers voice rolled out
as he led the anchor song

Pull my bully boys pull roared back the old familiar chorus the
mens bodies lifting and bending to the rhythm

Bub Russell paid the boatman and stepped on deck The anchor was
forgotten A mighty cheer went up from the men and almost before he
could catch his breath he was on the shoulders of the captain
surrounded by his mates and endeavoring to answer twenty questions to
the second

The next day a schooner hove to off a Japanese fishing village sent
ashore four sailors and a little midshipman and sailed away These men
did not talk English but they had money and quickly made their way to
Yokohama From that day the Japanese village folk never heard anything
more about them and they are still a muchtalkedof mystery As the
Russian government never said anything about the incident the United
States is still ignorant of the whereabouts of the lost poacher nor has
she ever heard officially of the way in which some of her citizens
shanghaied five subjects of the tsar Even nations have secrets
sometimes




THE BANKS OF THE SACRAMENTO

  And its blow ye winds heighho
  For Californio
  For theres plenty of gold so Ive been told
  On the banks of the Sacramento


It was only a little boy singing in a shrill treble the sea chantey
which seamen sing the wide world over when they man the capstan bars and
break the anchors out for Frisco port It was only a little boy who
had never seen the sea but two hundred feet beneath him rolled the
Sacramento Young Jerry he was called after Old Jerry his father
from whom he had learned the song as well as received his shock of
brightred hair his blue dancing eyes and his fair and inevitably
freckled skin

For Old Jerry had been a sailor and had followed the sea till middle
life haunted always by the words of the ringing chantey Then one day
he had sung the song in earnest in an Asiatic port swinging and
thrilling round the capstancircle with twenty others And at San
Francisco he turned his back upon his ship and upon the sea and went
to behold with his own eyes the banks of the Sacramento

He beheld the gold too for he found employment at the Yellow Dream
mine and proved of utmost usefulness in rigging the great orecables
across the river and two hundred feet above its surface

After that he took charge of the cables and kept them in repair and ran
them and loved them and became himself an indispensable fixture of the
Yellow Dream mine Then he loved pretty Margaret Kelly but she had left
him and Young Jerry the latter barely toddling to take up her last
long sleep in the little graveyard among the great sober pines

Old Jerry never went back to the sea He remained by his cables and
lavished upon them and Young Jerry all the love of his nature When evil
days came to the YellowDream he still remained in the employ of the
company as watchman over the all but abandoned property

But this morning he was not visible Young Jerry only was to be seen
sitting on the cabin step and singing the ancient chantey He had cooked
and eaten his breakfast all by himself and had just come out to take a
look at the world Twenty feet before him stood the steel drum round
which the endless cable worked By the drum snug and fast was the
orecar Following with his eyes the dizzy flight of the cables to the
farther bank he could see the other drum and the other car

The contrivance was worked by gravity the loaded car crossing the river
by virtue of its own weight and at the same time dragging the empty car
back The loaded car being emptied and the empty car being loaded with
more ore the performance could be repeateda performance which had
been repeated tens of thousands of times since the day Old Jerry became
the keeper of the cables

Young Jerry broke off his song at the sound of approaching footsteps A
tall blueshirted man a rifle across the hollow of his arm came out
from the gloom of the pinetrees It was Hall watchman of the Yellow
Dragon mine the cables of which spanned the Sacramento a mile farther
up

Hello younker was his greeting What you doin here by your
lonesome

Oh bachin Jerry tried to answer unconcernedly as if it were a very
ordinary sort of thing Dads away you see

Wheres he gone the man asked

San Francisco Went last night His brothers dead in the old country
and hes gone down to see the lawyers Wont be back till tomorrow
night

So spoke Jerry and with pride because of the responsibility which had
fallen to him of keeping an eye on the property of the Yellow Dream and
the glorious adventure of living alone on the cliff above the river and
of cooking his own meals

Well take care of yourself Hall said and dont monkey with the
cables Im goin to see if I cant pick up a deer in the Cripple Cow
Caon

Its goin to rain I think Jerry said with mature deliberation

And its little I mind a wettin Hall laughed as he strode away
among the trees

Jerrys prediction concerning rain was more than fulfilled By ten
oclock the pines were swaying and moaning the cabin windows rattling
and the rain driving by in fierce squalls At half past eleven he
kindled a fire and promptly at the stroke of twelve sat down to his
dinner

No outofdoors for him that day he decided when he had washed the few
dishes and put them neatly away and he wondered how wet Hall was and
whether he had succeeded in picking up a deer

At one oclock there came a knock at the door and when he opened it a
man and a woman staggered in on the breast of a great gust of wind They
were Mr and Mrs Spillane ranchers who lived in a lonely valley a
dozen miles back from the river

Wheres Hall was Spillanes opening speech and he spoke sharply and
quickly

Jerry noted that he was nervous and abrupt in his movements and that
Mrs Spillane seemed laboring under some strong anxiety She was a thin
washedout workedout woman whose life of dreary and unending toil had
stamped itself harshly upon her face It was the same life that had
bowed her husbands shoulders and gnarled his hands and turned his hair
to a dry and dusty gray

Hes gone hunting up Cripple Cow Jerry answered Did you want to
cross

The woman began to weep quietly while Spillane dropped a troubled
exclamation and strode to the window Jerry joined him in gazing out to
where the cables lost themselves in the thick downpour

It was the custom of the backwoods people in that section of country
to cross the Sacramento on the Yellow Dragon cable For this service a
small toll was charged which tolls the Yellow Dragon Company applied to
the payment of Halls wages

Weve got to get across Jerry Spillane said at the same time
jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of his wife Her
fathers hurt at the Clover Leaf Powder explosion Not expected to
live We just got word

Jerry felt himself fluttering inwardly He knew that Spillane wanted to
cross on the Yellow Dream cable and in the absence of his father he
felt that he dared not assume such a responsibility for the cable had
never been used for passengers in fact had not been used at all for a
long time

Maybe Hall will be back soon he said

Spillane shook his head and demanded Wheres your father

San Francisco Jerry answered briefly

Spillane groaned and fiercely drove his clenched fist into the palm of
the other hand His wife was crying more audibly and Jerry could hear
her murmuring And daddys dyin dyin

The tears welled up in his own eyes and he stood irresolute not
knowing what he should do But the man decided for him

Look here kid he said with determination the wife and me are
goin over on this here cable of yours Will you run it for us

Jerry backed slightly away He did it unconsciously as if recoiling
instinctively from something unwelcome

Better see if Halls back he suggested

And if he aint

Again Jerry hesitated

Ill stand for the risk Spillane added Dont you see kid weve
simply got to cross

Jerry nodded his head reluctantly

And there aint no use waitin for Hall Spillane went on You know
as well as me he aint back from Cripple Cow this time of day So come
along and lets get started

No wonder that Mrs Spillane seemed terrified as they helped her
into the orecarso Jerry thought as he gazed into the apparently
fathomless gulf beneath her For it was so filled with rain and cloud
hurtling and curling in the fierce blast that the other shore seven
hundred feet away was invisible while the cliff at their feet dropped
sheer down and lost itself in the swirling vapor By all appearances it
might be a mile to bottom instead of two hundred feet

All ready he asked

Let her go Spillane shouted to make himself heard above the roar of
the wind

He had clambered in beside his wife and was holding one of her hands in
his

Jerry looked upon this with disapproval Youll need all your hands for
holdin on the way the winds yowlin

The man and the woman shifted their hands accordingly tightly gripping
the sides of the car and Jerry slowly and carefully released the brake
The drum began to revolve as the endless cable passed round it and the
car slid slowly out into the chasm its trolley wheels rolling on the
stationary cable overhead to which it was suspended

It was not the first time Jerry had worked the cable but it was the
first time he had done so away from the supervising eye of his father
By means of the brake he regulated the speed of the car It needed
regulating for at times caught by the stronger gusts of wind it
swayed violently back and forth and once just before it was swallowed
up in a rain squall it seemed about to spill out its human contents

After that Jerry had no way of knowing where the car was except by means
of the cable This he watched keenly as it glided around the drum
Three hundred feet he breathed to himself as the cable markings went
by three hundred and fifty four hundred four hundred and

The cable had stopped Jerry threw off the brake but it did not move
He caught the cable with his hands and tried to start it by tugging
smartly Something had gone wrong What He could not guess he could
not see Looking up he could vaguely make out the empty car which had
been crossing from the opposite cliff at a speed equal to that of the
loaded car It was about two hundred and fifty feet away That meant he
knew that somewhere in the gray obscurity two hundred feet above the
river and two hundred and fifty feet from the other bank Spillane and
his wife were suspended and stationary

Three times Jerry shouted with all the shrill force of his lungs but
no answering cry came out of the storm It was impossible for him to
hear them or to make himself heard As he stood for a moment thinking
rapidly the flying clouds seemed to thin and lift He caught a brief
glimpse of the swollen Sacramento beneath and a briefer glimpse of the
car and the man and woman Then the clouds descended thicker than ever

The boy examined the drum closely and found nothing the matter with it
Evidently it was the drum on the other side that had gone wrong He was
appalled at thought of the man and woman out there in the midst of the
storm hanging over the abyss rocking back and forth in the frail car
and ignorant of what was taking place on shore And he did not like to
think of their hanging there while he went round by the Yellow Dragon
cable to the other drum

But he remembered a block and tackle in the toolhouse and ran and
brought it They were double blocks and he murmured aloud A purchase
of four as he made the tackle fast to the endless cable Then he
heaved upon it heaved until it seemed that his arms were being drawn
out from their sockets and that his shoulder muscles would be ripped
asunder Yet the cable did not budge Nothing remained but to cross over
to the other side

He was already soaking wet so he did not mind the rain as he ran over
the trail to the Yellow Dragon The storm was with him and it was easy
going although there was no Hall at the other end of it to man the
brake for him and regulate the speed of the car This he did for
himself however by means of a stout rope which he passed with a
turn round the stationary cable

As the full force of the wind struck him in midair swaying the cable
and whistling and roaring past it and rocking and careening the car he
appreciated more fully what must be the condition of mind of Spillane
and his wife And this appreciation gave strength to him as safely
across he fought his way up the other bank in the teeth of the gale
to the Yellow Dream cable

To his consternation he found the drum in thorough working order
Everything was running smoothly at both ends Where was the hitch In
the middle without a doubt

From this side the car containing Spillane was only two hundred and
fifty feet away He could make out the man and woman through the
whirling vapor crouching in the bottom of the car and exposed to the
pelting rain and the full fury of the wind In a lull between the
squalls he shouted to Spillane to examine the trolley of the car

Spillane heard for he saw him rise up cautiously on his knees and with
his hands go over both trolleywheels Then he turned his face toward
the bank

Shes all right kid

Jerry heard the words faint and far as from a remote distance Then
what was the matter Nothing remained but the other and empty car which
he could not see but which he knew to be there somewhere in that
terrible gulf two hundred feet beyond Spillanes car

His mind was made up on the instant He was only fourteen years old
slightly and wirily built but his life had been lived among the
mountains his father had taught him no small measure of sailoring
and he was not particularly afraid of heights

In the toolbox by the drum he found an old monkeywrench and a short
bar of iron also a coil of fairly new Manila rope He looked in vain
for a piece of board with which to rig a boatswains chair There was
nothing at hand but large planks which he had no means of sawing so he
was compelled to do without the more comfortable form of saddle

The saddle he rigged was very simple With the rope he made merely a
large loop round the stationary cable to which hung the empty car When
he sat in the loop his hands could just reach the cable conveniently
and where the rope was likely to fray against the cable he lashed his
coat in lieu of the old sack he would have used had he been able to
find one

These preparations swiftly completed he swung out over the chasm
sitting in the rope saddle and pulling himself along the cable by his
hands With him he carried the monkeywrench and short iron bar and a
few spare feet of rope It was a slightly uphill pull but this he did
not mind so much as the wind When the furious gusts hurled him back and
forth sometimes half twisting him about and he gazed down into the
gray depths he was aware that he was afraid It was an old cable What
if it should break under his weight and the pressure of the wind

It was fear he was experiencing honest fear and he knew that there was
a gone feeling in the pit of his stomach and a trembling of the knees
which he could not quell

But he held himself bravely to the task The cable was old and worn
sharp pieces of wire projected from it and his hands were cut and
bleeding by the time he took his first rest and held a shouted
conversation with Spillane The car was directly beneath him and only a
few feet away so he was able to explain the condition of affairs and
his errand

Wish I could help you Spillane shouted at him as he started on but
the wifes gone all to pieces Anyway kid take care of yourself I got
myself in this fix but its up to you to get me out

Oh Ill do it Jerry shouted back Tell Mrs Spillane that shell be
ashore now in a jiffy

In the midst of pelting rain which halfblinded him swinging from side
to side like a rapid and erratic pendulum his torn hands paining him
severely and his lungs panting from his exertions and panting from the
very air which the wind sometimes blew into his mouth with strangling
force he finally arrived at the empty car

A single glance showed him that he had not made the dangerous journey in
vain The front trolleywheel loose from long wear had jumped the
cable and the cable was now jammed tightly between the wheel and the
sheaveblock

One thing was clearthe wheel must be removed from the block A second
thing was equally clearwhile the wheel was being removed the car would
have to be fastened to the cable by the rope he had brought

At the end of a quarter of an hour beyond making the car secure he
had accomplished nothing The key which bound the wheel on its axle was
rusted and jammed He hammered at it with one hand and held on the best
he could with the other but the wind persisted in swinging and twisting
his body and made his blows miss more often than not Ninetenths of
the strength he expended was in trying to hold himself steady For fear
that he might drop the monkeywrench he made it fast to his wrist with
his handkerchief

At the end of half an hour Jerry had hammered the key clear but he
could not draw it out A dozen times it seemed that he must give up
in despair that all the danger and toil he had gone through were for
nothing Then an idea came to him and he went through his pockets with
feverish haste and found what he soughta tenpenny nail

But for that nail put in his pocket he knew not when or why he would
have had to make another trip over the cable and back Thrusting the
nail through the looped head of the key he at last had a grip and in
no time the key was out

Then came punching and prying with the iron bar to get the wheel itself
free from where it was jammed by the cable against the side of the
block After that Jerry replaced the wheel and by means of the rope
heaved up on the car till the trolley once more rested properly on the
cable

All this took time More than an hour and a half had elapsed since his
arrival at the empty car And now for the first time he dropped out of
his saddle and down into the car He removed the detaining ropes and
the trolleywheels began slowly to revolve The car was moving and he
knew that somewhere beyond although he could not see the car of
Spillane was likewise moving and in the opposite direction

There was no need for a brake for his weight sufficiently
counterbalanced the weight in the other car and soon he saw the cliff
rising out of the cloud depths and the old familiar drum going round and
round

Jerry climbed out and made the car securely fast He did it deliberately
and carefully and then quite unherolike he sank down by the drum
regardless of the pelting storm and burst out sobbing

There were many reasons why he sobbedpartly from the pain of his
hands which was excruciating partly from exhaustion partly from
relief and release from the nervetension he had been under for so long
and in a large measure from thankfulness that the man and woman were
saved

They were not there to thank him but somewhere beyond that howling
stormdriven gulf he knew they were hurrying over the trail toward the
Clover Leaf

Jerry staggered to the cabin and his hand left the white knob red with
blood as he opened the door but he took no notice of it

He was too proudly contented with himself for he was certain that he
had done well and he was honest enough to admit to himself that he had
done well But a small regret arose and persisted in his thoughtsif
his father had only been there to see




CHRIS FARRINGTON ABLE SEAMAN


If you vas in der old country ships a liddle shaver like you vood pe
only der boy und you vood wait on der able seamen Und ven der able
seaman sing out Boy der waterjug you vood jump quick like a shot
und bring der waterjug Und ven der able seaman sing out Boy my
boots you vood get der boots Und you vood pe politeful und say
Yessir und No sir But you pe in der American ship und you tink
you are so good as der able seamen Chris mine boy I haf ben a
sailorman for twentytwo years und do you tink you are so good as me
I vas a sailorman pefore you vas borned und I knot und reef und splice
ven you play mit topstrings und fly kites

But you are unfair Emil cried Chris Farrington his sensitive face
flushed and hurt He was a slender though strongly built young fellow of
seventeen with Yankee ancestry writ large all over him

Dere you go vonce again the Swedish sailor exploded My name is
Mister Johansen und a kid of a boy like you call me Emil It vas
insulting und comes pecause of der American ship

But you call me Chris the boy expostulated reproachfully

But you vas a boy

Who does a mans work Chris retorted And because I do a mans work
I have as much right to call you by your first name as you me We are
all equals in this focastle and you know it When we signed for the
voyage in San Francisco we signed as sailors on the Sophie
Sutherland and there was no difference made with any of us Havent
I always done my work Did I ever shirk Did you or any other man ever
have to take a wheel for me Or a lookout Or go aloft

Chris is right interrupted a young English sailor No man has had to
do a tap of his work yet He signed as good as any of us and hes shown
himself as good

Better broke in a Nova Scotia man Better than some of us When
we struck the sealinggrounds he turned out to be next to the best
boatsteerer aboard Only French Louis whod been at it for years
could beat him Im only a boatpuller and youre only a boatpuller
too Emil Johansen for all your twentytwo years at sea Why dont you
become a boatsteerer

Too clumsy laughed the Englishman and too slow

Little that counts one way or the other joined in Dane Jurgensen
coming to the aid of his Scandinavian brother Emil is a man grown and
an able seaman the boy is neither

And so the argument raged back and forth the Swedes Norwegians and
Danes because of race kinship taking the part of Johansen and the
English Canadians and Americans taking the part of Chris From an
unprejudiced point of view the right was on the side of Chris As he
had truly said he did a mans work and the same work that any of them
did But they were prejudiced and badly so and out of the words which
passed rose a standing quarrel which divided the forecastle into two
parties

                                   

The Sophie Sutherland was a sealhunter registered out of San
Francisco and engaged in hunting the furry seaanimals along the
Japanese coast north to Bering Sea The other vessels were twomasted
schooners but she was a threemaster and the largest in the fleet In
fact she was a fullrigged threetopmast schooner newly built

Although Chris Farrington knew that justice was with him and that he
performed all his work faithfully and well many a time in secret
thought he longed for some pressing emergency to arise whereby he could
demonstrate to the Scandinavian seamen that he also was an able seaman

But one stormy night by an accident for which he was in nowise
accountable in overhauling a spare anchorchain he had all the fingers
of his left hand badly crushed And his hopes were likewise crushed for
it was impossible for him to continue hunting with the boats and he was
forced to stay idly aboard until his fingers should heal Yet although
he little dreamed it this very accident was to give him the
longlookedfor opportunity

One afternoon in the latter part of May the Sophie Sutherland
rolled sluggishly in a breathless calm The seals were abundant the
hunting good and the boats were all away and out of sight And with
them was almost every man of the crew Besides Chris there remained
only the captain the sailingmaster and the Chinese cook

The captain was captain only by courtesy He was an old man past
eighty and blissfully ignorant of the sea and its ways but he was the
owner of the vessel and hence the honorable title Of course the
sailingmaster who was really captain was a thoroughgoing seaman The
mate whose post was aboard was out with the boats having temporarily
taken Chriss place as boatsteerer

When good weather and good sport came together the boats were
accustomed to range far and wide and often did not return to the
schooner until long after dark But for all that it was a perfect
hunting day Chris noted a growing anxiety on the part of the
sailingmaster He paced the deck nervously and was constantly sweeping
the horizon with his marine glasses Not a boat was in sight As sunset
arrived he even sent Chris aloft to the mizzentopmasthead but with
no better luck The boats could not possibly be back before midnight

Since noon the barometer had been falling with startling rapidity and
all the signs were ripe for a great stormhow great not even the
sailingmaster anticipated He and Chris set to work to prepare for
it They put storm gaskets on the furled topsails lowered and stowed
the foresail and spanker and took in the two inner jibs In the one
remaining jib they put a single reef and a single reef in the mainsail

Night had fallen before they finished and with the darkness came the
storm A low moan swept over the sea and the wind struck the Sophie
Sutherland flat But she righted quickly and with the sailingmaster
at the wheel sheered her bow into within five points of the wind
Working as well as he could with his bandaged hand and with the feeble
aid of the Chinese cook Chris went forward and backed the jib over to
the weather side This with the flat mainsail left the schooner hove to

God help the boats Its no gale Its a typhoon the sailingmaster
shouted to Chris at eleven oclock Too much canvas Got to get two
more reefs into that mainsail and got to do it right away He glanced
at the old captain shivering in oilskins at the binnacle and holding on
for dear life Theres only you and I Chrisand the cook but hes
next to worthless

In order to make the reef it was necessary to lower the mainsail and
the removal of this after pressure was bound to make the schooner fall
off before the wind and sea because of the forward pressure of the jib

Take the wheel the sailingmaster directed And when I give the
word hard up with it And when shes square before it steady her And
keep her there Well heave to again as soon as I get the reefs in

Gripping the kicking spokes Chris watched him and the reluctant cook go
forward into the howling darkness The Sophie Sutherland was
plunging into the huge headseas and wallowing tremendously the tense
steel stays and taut rigging humming like harpstrings to the wind A
buffeted cry came to his ears and he felt the schooners bow paying off
of its own accord The mainsail was down

He ran the wheel hardover and kept anxious track of the changing
direction of the wind on his face and of the heave of the vessel This
was the crucial moment In performing the evolution she would have to
pass broadside to the surge before she could get before it The wind was
blowing directly on his right cheek when he felt the Sophie
Sutherland lean over and begin to rise toward the skyupupan
infinite distance Would she clear the crest of the gigantic wave

Again by the feel of it for he could see nothing he knew that a wall
of water was rearing and curving far above him along the whole weather
side There was an instants calm as the liquid wall intervened and shut
off the wind The schooner righted and for that instant seemed at
perfect rest Then she rolled to meet the descending rush

Chris shouted to the captain to hold tight and prepared himself for the
shock But the man did not live who could face it An ocean of water
smote Chriss back and his clutch on the spokes was loosened as if it
were a babys Stunned powerless like a straw on the face of a
torrent he was swept onward he knew not whither Missing the corner of
the cabin he was dashed forward along the poop runway a hundred feet or
more striking violently against the foot of the foremast A second
wave crushing inboard hurled him back the way he had come and left
him halfdrowned where the poop steps should have been

Bruised and bleeding dimly conscious he felt for the rail and dragged
himself to his feet Unless something could be done he knew the last
moment had come As he faced the poop the wind drove into his mouth
with suffocating force This brought him back to his senses with a
start The wind was blowing from dead aft The schooner was out of the
trough and before it But the send of the sea was bound to breach her to
again Crawling up the runway he managed to get to the wheel just in
time to prevent this The binnacle light was still burning They were
safe

That is he and the schooner were safe As to the welfare of his three
companions he could not say Nor did he dare leave the wheel in order to
find out for it took every second of his undivided attention to keep
the vessel to her course The least fraction of carelessness and the
heave of the sea under the quarter was liable to thrust her into the
trough So a boy of one hundred and forty pounds he clung to his
herculean task of guiding the two hundred straining tons of fabric amid
the chaos of the great storm forces

Half an hour later groaning and sobbing the captain crawled to Chriss
feet All was lost he whimpered He was smitten unto death The galley
had gone by the board the mainsail and runninggear the cook
everything

Wheres the sailingmaster Chris demanded when he had caught his
breath after steadying a wild lurch of the schooner It was no childs
play to steer a vessel under singlereefed jib before a typhoon

Clean up forard the old man replied Jammed under the
focslehead but still breathing Both his arms are broken he says
and he doesnt know how many ribs Hes hurt bad

Well hell drown there the way shes shipping water through the
hawsepipes Go forard Chris commanded taking charge of things as a
matter of course Tell him not to worry that Im at the wheel Help
him as much as you can and make him helphe stopped and ran the
spokes to starboard as a tremendous billow rose under the stern and
yawed the schooner to portand make him help himself for the rest
Unship the focastle hatch and get him down into a bunk Then ship the
hatch again

The captain turned his aged face forward and wavered pitifully The
waist of the ship was full of water to the bulwarks He had just come
through it and knew death lurked every inch of the way

Go Chris shouted fiercely And as the fearstricken man started
And take another look for the cook

Two hours later almost dead from suffering the captain returned He
had obeyed orders The sailingmaster was helpless although safe in a
bunk the cook was gone Chris sent the captain below to the cabin to
change his clothes

After interminable hours of toil day broke cold and gray Chris looked
about him The Sophie Sutherland was racing before the typhoon
like a thing possessed There was no rain but the wind whipped the
spray of the sea masthigh obscuring everything except in the immediate
neighborhood

Two waves only could Chris see at a timethe one before and the one
behind So small and insignificant the schooner seemed on the long
Pacific roll Rushing up a maddening mountain she would poise like a
cockleshell on the giddy summit breathless and rolling leap outward
and down into the yawning chasm beneath and bury herself in the smother
of foam at the bottom Then the recovery another mountain another
sickening upward rush another poise and the downward crash Abreast of
him to starboard like a ghost of the storm Chris saw the cook dashing
apace with the schooner Evidently when washed overboard he had
grasped and become entangled in a trailing halyard

For three hours more alone with this gruesome companion Chris held the
Sophie Sutherland before the wind and sea He had long since
forgotten his mangled fingers The bandages had been torn away and the
cold salt spray had eaten into the halfhealed wounds until they were
numb and no longer pained But he was not cold The terrific labor of
steering forced the perspiration from every pore Yet he was faint and
weak with hunger and exhaustion and hailed with delight the advent on
deck of the captain who fed him all of a pound of cakechocolate It
strengthened him at once

He ordered the captain to cut the halyard by which the cooks body was
towing and also to go forward and cut loose the jibhalyard and sheet
When he had done so the jib fluttered a couple of moments like a
handkerchief then tore out of the boltropes and vanished The
Sophie Sutherland was running under bare poles

By noon the storm had spent itself and by six in the evening the waves
had died down sufficiently to let Chris leave the helm It was almost
hopeless to dream of the small boats weathering the typhoon but there
is always the chance in saving human life and Chris at once applied
himself to going back over the course along which he had fled He
managed to get a reef in one of the inner jibs and two reefs in the
spanker and then with the aid of the watchtackle to hoist them to
the stiff breeze that yet blew And all through the night tacking back
and forth on the back track he shook out canvas as fast as the wind
would permit

The injured sailingmaster had turned delirious and between tending him
and lending a hand with the ship Chris kept the captain busy Taught
me more seamanship as he afterward said than Id learned on the
whole voyage But by daybreak the old mans feeble frame succumbed and
he fell off into exhausted sleep on the weather poop

Chris who could now lash the wheel covered the tired man with blankets
from below and went fishing in the lazaretto for something to eat
But by the day following he found himself forced to give in drowsing
fitfully by the wheel and waking ever and anon to take a look at things

On the afternoon of the third day he picked up a schooner dismasted and
battered As he approached closehauled on the wind he saw her decks
crowded by an unusually large crew and on sailing in closer made out
among others the faces of his missing comrades And he was just in the
nick of time for they were fighting a losing fight at the pumps An
hour later they with the crew of the sinking craft were aboard the
Sophie Sutherland

Having wandered so far from their own vessel they had taken refuge on
the strange schooner just before the storm broke She was a Canadian
sealer on her first voyage and as was now apparent her last

The captain of the Sophie Sutherland had a story to tell also
and he told it wellso well in fact that when all hands were gathered
together on deck during the dogwatch Emil Johansen strode over to
Chris and gripped him by the hand

Chris he said so loudly that all could hear Chris I gif in You
vas yoost so good a sailorman as I You vas a bully boy und able
seaman und I pe proud for you

Und Chris He turned as if he had forgotten something and called
back From dis time always you call me Emil mitout der Mister




TO REPEL BOARDERS


No honest now Bob Im sure I was born too late The twentieth
centurys no place for me If Id had my way

Youd have been born in the sixteenth I broke in laughing with
Drake and Hawkins and Raleigh and the rest of the seakings

Youre right Paul affirmed He rolled over upon his back on the
little afterdeck with a long sigh of dissatisfaction

It was a little past midnight and with the wind nearly astern we were
running down Lower San Francisco Bay to Bay Farm Island Paul Fairfax
and I went to the same school lived next door to each other and
chummed it together By saving money by earning more and by
each of us foregoing a bicycle on his birthday we had collected
the purchaseprice of the Mist a beamy twentyeightfooter
slooprigged with baby topsail and centerboard Pauls father was a
yachtsman himself and he had conducted the business for us poking
around overhauling sticking his penknife into the timbers and testing
the planks with the greatest care In fact it was on his schooner
the Whim that Paul and I had picked up what we knew about
boatsailing and now that the Mist was ours we were hard at
work adding to our knowledge

The Mist being broad of beam was comfortable and roomy
A man could stand upright in the cabin and what with the stove
cookingutensils and bunks we were good for trips in her of a week at
a time And we were just starting out on the first of such trips and it
was because it was the first trip that we were sailing by night Early
in the evening we had beaten out from Oakland and we were now off the
mouth of Alameda Creek a large saltwater estuary which fills and
empties San Leandro Bay

Men lived in those days Paul said so suddenly as to startle me from
my own thoughts In the days of the seakings I mean he explained

I said Oh sympathetically and began to whistle Captain Kidd

Now Ive my ideas about things Paul went on They talk about
romance and adventure and all that but I say romance and adventure are
dead Were too civilized We dont have adventures in the twentieth
century We go to the circus

But I strove to interrupt though he would not listen to me

You look here Bob he said In all the time you and Ive gone
together what adventures have we had True we were out in the hills
once and didnt get back till late at night and we were good and
hungry but we werent even lost We knew where we were all the time It
was only a case of walk What I mean is weve never had to fight for
our lives Understand Weve never had a pistol fired at us or a
cannon or a sword waving over our heads oror anything

Youd better slack away three or four feet of that mainsheet he said
in a hopeless sort of way as though it did not matter much anyway The
winds still veering around

Why in the old times the sea was one constant glorious adventure
he continued A boy left school and became a midshipman and in a few
weeks was cruising after Spanish galleons or locking yardarms with a
French privateer ordoing lots of things

Wellthere are adventures today I objected

But Paul went on as though I had not spoken

And today we go from school to high school and from high school to
college and then we go into the office or become doctors and things
and the only adventures we know about are the ones we read in books
Why just as sure as Im sitting here on the stern of the sloop
Mist just so sure am I that we wouldnt know what to do if a
real adventure came along Now would we

Oh I dont know I answered noncommittally

Well you wouldnt be a coward would you he demanded

I was sure I wouldnt and said so

But you dont have to be a coward to lose your head do you

I agreed that brave men might get excited

Well then Paul summed up with a note of regret in his voice the
chances are that wed spoil the adventure So its a shame and thats
all I can say about it

The adventure hasnt come yet I answered not caring to see him down
in the mouth over nothing You see Paul was a peculiar fellow in some
things and I knew him pretty well He read a good deal and had a quick
imagination and once in a while hed get into moods like this one So I
said The adventure hasnt come yet so theres no use worrying about
its being spoiled For all we know it might turn out splendidly

Paul didnt say anything for some time and I was thinking he was out of
the mood when he spoke up suddenly

Just imagine Bob Kellogg as were sailing along now just as we are
and never mind what for that a boat should bear down upon us with armed
men in it what would you do to repel boarders Think you could rise to
it

What would you do I asked pointedly Remember we havent
even a single shotgun aboard

You would surrender then he demanded angrily But suppose they were
going to kill you

Im not saying what Id do I answered stiffly beginning to get a
little angry myself Im asking what youd do without weapons of any
sort

Id find something he repliedrather shortly I thought

I began to chuckle Then the adventure wouldnt be spoiled would it
And youve been talking rubbish

Paul struck a match looked at his watch and remarked that it was
nearly one oclocka way he had when the argument went against him
Besides this was the nearest we ever came to quarreling now though
our share of squabbles had fallen to us in the earlier days of our
friendship I had just seen a little white light ahead when Paul
spoke again

Anchorlight he said Funny place for people to drop the hook It
may be a scowschooner with a dinky astern so youd better go wide

I eased the Mist several points and the wind puffing up we
went plowing along at a pretty fair speed passing the light so wide
that we could not make out what manner of craft it marked Suddenly the
Mist slacked up in a slow and easy way as though running upon
soft mud We were both startled The wind was blowing stronger than
ever and yet we were almost at a standstill

Mudflat out here Never heard of such a thing

So Paul exclaimed with a snort of unbelief and seizing an oar shoved
it down over the side And straight down it went till the water wet
his hand There was no bottom Then we were dumbfounded The wind was
whistling by and still the Mist was moving ahead at a snails
pace There seemed something dead about her and it was all I could do
at the tiller to keep her from swinging up into the wind

Listen I laid my hand on Pauls arm We could hear the sound of
rowlocks and saw the little white light bobbing up and down and now
very close to us Theres your armed boat I whispered in fun
Beat the crew to quarters and stand by to repel boarders

We both laughed and were still laughing when a wild scream of rage came
out of the darkness and the approaching boat shot under our stern
By the light of the lantern it carried we could see the two men in it
distinctly They were foreignlooking fellows with sunbronzed faces
and with knitted tamoshanters perched seaman fashion on their heads
Brightcolored woolen sashes were around their waists and long
seaboots covered their legs I remember yet the cold chill which passed
along my backbone as I noted the tiny gold earrings in the ears of one
For all the world they were like pirates stepped out of the pages of
romance And to make the picture complete their faces were distorted
with anger and each flourished a long knife They were both shouting
in highpitched voices some foreign jargon we could not understand

One of them the smaller of the two and if anything the more
viciouslooking put his hands on the rail of the Mist and
started to come aboard Quick as a flash Paul placed the end of the oar
against the mans chest and shoved him back into his boat He fell in a
heap but scrambled to his feet waving the knife and shrieking

You breaka my neta You breaka my neta

And he held forth in the jargon again his companion joining him and
both preparing to make another dash to come aboard the Mist

Theyre Italian fishermen I cried the facts of the case breaking in
upon me Weve run over their smeltnet and its slipped along the
keel and fouled our rudder Were anchored to it

Yes and theyre murderous chaps too Paul said sparring at them
with the oar to make them keep their distance

Say you fellows he called to them Give us a chance and well get
it clear for you We didnt know your net was there We didnt mean to
do it you know

You wont lose anything I added Well pay the damages

But they could not understand what we were saying or did not care to
understand

You breaka my neta You breaka my neta the smaller man the one
with the earrings screamed back making furious gestures I fixa you
Youa see I fixa you

This time when Paul thrust him back he seized the oar in his hands
and his companion jumped aboard I put my back against the tiller and
no sooner had he landed and before he had caught his balance than I
met him with another oar and he fell heavily backward into the boat It
was getting serious and when he arose and caught my oar and I realized
his strength I confess that I felt a goodly tinge of fear But though
he was stronger than I instead of dragging me overboard when he
wrenched on the oar he merely pulled his boat in closer and when
I shoved the boat was forced away Besides the knife still in his
right hand made him awkward and somewhat counterbalanced the advantage
his superior strength gave him Paul and his enemy were in the same
situationa sort of deadlock which continued for several seconds but
which could not last Several times I shouted that we would pay for
whatever damage their net had suffered but my words seemed to be
without effect

Then my man began to tuck the oar under his arm and to come up along
it slowly hand over hand The small man did the same with Paul Moment
by moment they came closer and closer and we knew that the end was
only a question of time

Hard up Bob Paul called softly to me

I gave him a quick glance and caught an instants glimpse of what I
took to be a very pale face and a very set jaw

Oh Bob he pleaded hard up your helm Hard up your helm Bob

And his meaning dawned upon me Still holding to my end of the oar I
shoved the tiller over with my back and even bent my body to keep it
over As it was the Mist was nearly dead before the wind and
this maneuver was bound to force her to jibe her mainsail from one side
to the other I could tell by the feel when the wind spilled out of
the canvas and the boom tilted up Pauls man had now gained a footing
on the little deck and my man was just scrambling up

Look out I shouted to Paul Here she comes

Both he and I let go the oars and tumbled into the cockpit The next
instant the big boom and the heavy blocks swept over our heads the
mainsheet whipping past like a great coiling snake and the Mist
heeling over with a violent jar Both men had jumped for it but in some
way the little man either got his knifehand jammed or fell upon it for
the first sight we caught of him he was standing in his boat his
bleeding fingers clasped close between his knees and his face all
twisted with pain and helpless rage

Nows our chance Paul whispered Over with you

And on either side of the rudder we lowered ourselves into the water
pressing the net down with our feet till with a jerk it went clear
Then it was up and in Paul at the mainsheet and I at the tiller the
Mist plunging ahead with freedom in her motion and the little
white light astern growing small and smaller

Now that youve had your adventure do you feel any better I remember
asking when we had changed our clothes and were sitting dry and
comfortable again in the cockpit

Well if I dont have the nightmare for a week to comePaul paused
and puckered his brows in judicial fashionit will be because I cant
sleep thats one thing sure




AN ADVENTURE IN THE UPPER SEA


I am a retired captain of the upper sea That is to say when I was a
younger man which is not so long ago I was an aeronaut and navigated
that aerial ocean which is all around about us and above us Naturally
it is a hazardous profession and naturally I have had many thrilling
experiences the most thrilling or at least the most nerveracking
being the one I am about to relate

It happened before I went in for hydrogen gas balloons all of varnished
silk doubled and lined and all that and fit for voyages of days
instead of mere hours The Little Nassau named after the Great
Nassau of many years back was the balloon I was making ascents in at
the time It was a fairsized hotair affair of single thickness good
for an hours flight or so and capable of attaining an altitude of a
mile or more It answered my purpose for my act at the time was making
halfmile parachute jumps at recreation parks and country fairs I was
in Oakland a California town filling a summers engagement with a
street railway company The company owned a large park outside the city
and of course it was to its interest to provide attractions which would
send the townspeople over its line when they went out to get a whiff of
country air My contract called for two ascensions weekly and my act
was an especially taking feature for it was on my days that the largest
crowds were drawn

Before you can understand what happened I must first explain a bit
about the nature of the hot air balloon which is used for parachute
jumping If you have ever witnessed such a jump you will remember that
directly the parachute was cut loose the balloon turned upside down
emptied itself of its smoke and heated air flattened out and fell
straight down beating the parachute to the ground Thus there is no
chasing a big deserted bag for miles and miles across the country and
much time as well as trouble is thereby saved This maneuver is
accomplished by attaching a weight at the end of a long rope to the
top of the balloon The aeronaut with his parachute and trapeze hangs
to the bottom of the balloon and weighing more keeps it right side
down But when he lets go the weight attached to the top immediately
drags the top down and the bottom which is the open mouth goes up
the heated air pouring out The weight used for this purpose on the
Little Nassau was a bag of sand

On the particular day I have in mind there was an unusually large crowd
in attendance and the police had their hands full keeping the people
back There was much pushing and shoving and the ropes were bulging
with the pressure of men women and children As I came down from the
dressing room I noticed two girls outside the ropes of about fourteen
and sixteen and inside the rope a youngster of eight or nine They
were holding him by the hands and he was struggling excitedly and
half in laughter to get away from them I thought nothing of it at
the timejust a bit of childish play no more and it was only in the
light of after events that the scene was impressed vividly upon me

Keep them cleared out George I called to my assistant We dont
want any accidents

Ay he answered that I will Charley

George Guppy had helped me in no end of ascents and because of his
coolness judgment and absolute reliability I had come to trust my life
in his hands with the utmost confidence His business it was to overlook
the inflating of the balloon and to see that everything about the
parachute was in perfect working order

The Little Nassau was already filled and straining at the guys The
parachute lay flat along the ground and beyond it the trapeze I tossed
aside my overcoat took my position and gave the signal to let go As
you know the first rush upward from the earth is very sudden and this
time the balloon when it first caught the wind heeled violently over
and was longer than usual in righting I looked down at the old familiar
sight of the world rushing away from me And there were the thousands of
people every face silently upturned And the silence startled me for
as crowds went this was the time for them to catch their first breath
and send up a roar of applause But there was no handclapping
whistling cheeringonly silence And instead clear as a bell and
distinct without the slightest shake or quaver came Georges voice
through the megaphone

Ride her down Charley Ride the balloon down

What had happened I waved my hand to show that I had heard and began
to think Had something gone wrong with the parachute Why should I ride
the balloon down instead of making the jump which thousands were waiting
to see What was the matter And as I puzzled I received another start
The earth was a thousand feet beneath and yet I heard a child crying
softly and seemingly very close to hand And though the Little Nassau
was shooting skyward like a rocket the crying did not grow fainter and
fainter and die away I confess I was almost on the edge of a funk
when unconsciously following up the noise with my eyes I looked above
me and saw a boy astride the sandbag which was to bring the Little
Nassau to earth And it was the same little boy I had seen struggling
with the two girlshis sisters as I afterward learned

There he was astride the sandbag and holding on to the rope for
dear life A puff of wind heeled the balloon slightly and he swung out
into space for ten or a dozen feet and back again fetching up against
the tight canvas with a thud which even shook me thirty feet or more
beneath I thought to see him dashed loose but he clung on and
whimpered They told me afterward how at the moment they were casting
off the balloon the little fellow had torn away from his sisters
ducked under the rope and deliberately jumped astride the sandbag It
has always been a wonder to me that he was not jerked off in the first
rush

Well I felt sick all over as I looked at him there and I understood
why the balloon had taken longer to right itself and why George had
called after me to ride her down Should I cut loose with the parachute
the bag would at once turn upside down empty itself and begin its
swift descent The only hope lay in my riding her down and in the boy
holding on There was no possible way for me to reach him No man could
climb the slim closed parachute and even if a man could and made the
mouth of the balloon what could he do Straight out and fifteen feet
away trailed the boy on his ticklish perch and those fifteen feet were
empty space

I thought far more quickly than it takes to tell all this and realized
on the instant that the boys attention must be called away from his
terrible danger Exercising all the selfcontrol I possessed and
striving to make myself very calm I said cheerily

Hello up there who are you

He looked down at me choking back his tears and brightening up but
just then the balloon ran into a crosscurrent turned half around and
lay over This set him swinging back and forth and he fetched the
canvas another bump Then he began to cry again

Isnt it great I asked heartily as though it was the most enjoyable
thing in the world and without waiting for him to answer Whats your
name

Tommy Dermott he answered

Glad to make your acquaintance Tommy Dermott I went on But Id
like to know who said you could ride up with me

He laughed and said he just thought hed ride up for the fun of it And
so we went on I sick with fear for him and cudgeling my brains to keep
up the conversation I knew that it was all I could do and that his
life depended upon my ability to keep his mind off his danger I pointed
out to him the great panorama spreading away to the horizon and four
thousand feet beneath us There lay San Francisco Bay like a great
placid lake the haze of smoke over the city the Golden Gate the ocean
fogrim beyond and Mount Tamalpais over all clearcut and sharp
against the sky Directly below us I could see a buggy apparently
crawling but I knew from experience that the men in it were lashing the
horses on our trail

But he grew tired of looking around and I could see he was beginning to
get frightened

How would you like to go in for the business I asked

He cheered up at once and asked Do you get good pay

But the Little Nassau beginning to cool had started on its long
descent and ran into counter currents which bobbed it roughly about
This swung the boy around pretty lively smashing him into the bag once
quite severely His lip began to tremble at this and he was crying
again I tried to joke and laugh but it was no use His pluck was
oozing out and at any moment I was prepared to see him go shooting
past me

I was in despair Then suddenly I remembered how one fright could
destroy another fright and I frowned up at him and shouted sternly

You just hold on to that rope If you dont Ill thrash you within an
inch of your life when I get you down on the ground Understand

Yeyeyes sir he whimpered and I saw that the thing had worked I
was nearer to him than the earth and he was more afraid of me than of
falling

Why youve got a snap up there on that soft bag I rattled on

Yes I assured him this bar down here is hard and narrow and it
hurts to sit on it

Then a thought struck him and he forgot all about his aching fingers

When are you going to jump he asked Thats what I came up to see

I was sorry to disappoint him but I wasnt going to make any jump

But he objected to that It said so in the papers he said

I dont care I answered Im feeling sort of lazy today and Im
just going to ride down the balloon Its my balloon and I guess I can
do as I please about it And anyway were almost down now

And we were too and sinking fast And right there and then that
youngster began to argue with me as to whether it was right for me to
disappoint the people and to urge their claims upon me And it was
with a happy heart that I held up my end of it justifying myself in a
thousand different ways till we shot over a grove of eucalyptus trees
and dipped to meet the earth

Hold on tight I shouted swinging down from the trapeze by my hands
in order to make a landing on my feet

We skimmed past a barn missed a mesh of clothesline frightened
the barnyard chickens into a panic and rose up again clear over a
haystackall this almost quicker than it takes to tell Then we came
down in an orchard and when my feet had touched the ground I fetched up
the balloon by a couple of turns of the trapeze around an apple tree

I have had my balloon catch fire in mid air I have hung on the cornice
of a tenstory house I have dropped like a bullet for six hundred feet
when a parachute was slow in opening but never have I felt so weak and
faint and sick as when I staggered toward the unscratched boy and
gripped him by the arm

Tommy Dermott I said when I had got my nerves back somewhat Tommy
Dermott Im going to lay you across my knee and give you the greatest
thrashing a boy ever got in the worlds history

No you dont he answered squirming around You said you wouldnt
if I held on tight

Thats all right I said but Im going to just the same The
fellows who go up in balloons are bad unprincipled men and Im going
to give you a lesson right now to make you stay away from them and from
balloons too

And then I gave it to him and if it wasnt the greatest thrashing in
the world it was the greatest he ever got

But it took all the grit out of me left me nervebroken that
experience I canceled the engagement with the street railway company
and later on went in for gas Gas is much the safer anyway




BALDFACE


Talkin of bear

The Klondike King paused meditatively and the group on the hotel porch
hitched their chairs up closer

Talkin of bear he went on now up in the Northern Country there are
various kinds On the Little Pelly for instance they come down that
thick in the summer to feed on the salmon that you cant get an Indian
or white man to go nigher than a days journey to the place And up
in the Rampart Mountains theres a curious kind of bear called the
sidehill grizzly Thats because hes traveled on the sidehills ever
since the Flood and the two legs on the downhill side are twice as
long as the two on the uphill And he can outrun a jack rabbit when he
gets steam up Dangerous Catch you Bless you no All a man has to do
is to circle down the hill and run the other way You see that throws
mister bears long legs up the hill and the short ones down Yes hes a
mighty peculiar creature but that wasnt what I started in to tell
about

Theyve got another kind of bear up on the Yukon and his legs are all
right too Hes called the baldface grizzly and hes jest as big as
he is bad Its only the fool white men that think of hunting him
Indians got too much sense But theres one thing about the baldface
that a man has to learn he never gives the trail to mortal creature
If you see him comin and you value your skin you get out of his path
If you dont theres bound to be trouble If the baldface met Jehovah
Himself on the trail hed not give him an inch O hes a selfish
beggar take my word for it But I had to learn all this Didnt know
anything about bear when I went into the country exceptin when I was a
youngster Id seen a heap of cinnamons and that little black kind And
they was nothin to be scared at

Well after wed got settled down on our claim I went up on the hill
lookin for a likely piece of birch to make an axhandle out of But
it was pretty hard to find the right kind and I kept agoin and kept
agoin for nigh on two hours Wasnt in no hurry to make my choice you
see for I was headin down to the Forks where I was goin to borrow a
logbit from Old Joe Gee When I started Id put a couple of sourdough
biscuits and some sowbelly in my pocket in case I might get hungry
And Im tellin you that lunch came in right handy before I was done
with it

Bimeby I hit upon the likeliest little birch saplin right in the
middle of a clump of jack pine Jest as I raised my handax I happened
to cast my eyes down the hill There was a big bear comin up swingin
along on all fours right in my direction It was a baldface but
little I knew then about such kind

Jest watch me scare him I says to myself and I stayed out of sight
in the trees

Well I waited till he was about a hundred feet off then out I runs
into the open

Oof oof I hollered at him expectin to see him turn tail like
chain lightning

Turn tail He jest throwed up his head for one good look and came a
comin

Oof oof I hollered loudern ever But he jest came a comin

Consarn you I says to myself gettin mad Ill make you jump the
trail

So I grabs my hat and wavin and hollerin starts down the trail to
meet him A big sugar pine had gone down in a windfall and lay about
breast high I stops jest behind it old baldface comin all the time
It was jest then that fear came to me I yelled like a Comanche Indian
as he raised up to come over the log and fired my hat full in his face
Then I lit out

Say I rounded the end of that log and put down the hill at a
twotwenty clip old baldface reachin for me at every jump At the
bottom was a broad open flat quarter of a mile to timber and full of
niggerheads I knew if ever I slipped I was a goner but I hit only the
high places till you couldnt aseen my trail for smoke And the old
devil snortin along hot after me Midway across he reached for me
jest strikin the heel of my moccasin with his claw Tell you I was
doin some tall thinkin jest then I knew he had the wind of me and I
could never make the brush so I pulled my little lunch out of my pocket
and dropped it on the fly

Never looked back till I hit the timber and then he was mouthing the
biscuits in a way which wasnt nice to see considerin how close hed
been to me I never slacked up No sir Jest kept hittin the trail for
all there was in me But jest as I came around a bend heelin it right
lively I tell you whatd I see in middle of the trail before me and
comin my way but another baldface

Whoof he says when he spotted me and he came arunnin

Instanter I was about and hittin the back trail twice as fast as Id
come The way this one was puffin after me Id clean forgot all about
the other baldface First thing I knew I seen him mosying along kind of
easy wonderin most likely what had become of me and if I tasted as
good as my lunch Say when he seen me he looked real pleased And then
he came ajumpin for me

Whoof he says

Whoof says the one behind me

Bang I goes slap off the trail sideways aplungin and aclawin
through the brush like a wild man By this time I was clean crazed
thought the whole country was full of baldfaces Next thing I
knowswhop I comes up against something in a tangle of wild blackberry
bushes Then that something hits me a slap and closes in on me Another
baldface And then and there I knew I was gone for sure But I made up
to die game and of all the rampin and roarin and rippin and tearin
you ever see that was the worst

My God O my wife it says And I looked and it was a man I was
hammering into kingdom come

Thought you was a bear says I

He kind of caught his breath and looked at me Then he says Same
here

Seemed as though hed been chased by a baldface too and had hid in
the blackberries So thats how we mistook each other

But by that time the racket on the trail was something terrible and we
didnt wait to explain matters That afternoon we got Joe Gee and some
rifles and came back loaded for bear Mebbe you wont believe me but
when we got to the spot there was the two baldfaces lyin dead You
see when I jumped out they came together and each refused to give
trail to the other So they fought it out Talkin of bear As I was
sayin




IN YEDDO BAY


Somewhere along Theater Street he had lost it He remembered being
hustled somewhat roughly on the bridge over one of the canals that
cross that busy thoroughfare Possibly some slanteyed lightfingered
pickpocket was even then enjoying the fiftyodd yen his purse had
contained And then again he thought he might have lost it himself
just lost it carelessly

Hopelessly and for the twentieth time he searched in all his pockets
for the missing purse It was not there His hand lingered in his
empty hippocket and he woefully regarded the voluble and vociferous
restaurantkeeper who insanely clamored Twentyfive sen You pay now
Twentyfive sen

But my purse the boy said I tell you Ive lost it somewhere

Whereupon the restaurantkeeper lifted his arms indignantly and
shrieked Twentyfive sen Twentyfive sen You pay now

Quite a crowd had collected and it was growing embarrassing for Alf
Davis

It was so ridiculous and petty Alf thought Such a disturbance about
nothing And decidedly he must be doing something Thoughts of diving
wildly through that forest of legs and of striking out at whomsoever
opposed him flashed through his mind but as though divining his
purpose one of the waiters a short and chunky chap with an
evillooking cast in one eye seized him by the arm

You pay now You pay now Twentyfive sen yelled the proprietor
hoarse with rage

Alf was red in the face too from mortification but he resolutely set
out on another exploration He had given up the purse pinning his last
hope on stray coins In the little changepocket of his coat he found
a tensen piece and fivecopper sen and remembering having recently
missed a tensen piece he cut the seam of the pocket and resurrected
the coin from the depths of the lining Twentyfive sen he held in his
hand the sum required to pay for the supper he had eaten He turned
them over to the proprietor who counted them grew suddenly calm and
bowed obsequiouslyin fact the whole crowd bowed obsequiously and
melted away

Alf Davis was a young sailor just turned sixteen on board the Annie
Mine an American sailingschooner which had run into Yokohama to
ship its seasons catch of skins to London And in this his second trip
ashore he was beginning to snatch his first puzzling glimpses of the
Oriental mind He laughed when the bowing and kotowing was over and
turned on his heel to confront another problem How was he to get aboard
ship It was eleven oclock at night and there would be no ships boats
ashore while the outlook for hiring a native boatman with nothing but
empty pockets to draw upon was not particularly inviting

Keeping a sharp lookout for shipmates he went down to the pier At
Yokohama there are no long lines of wharves The shipping lies out at
anchor enabling a few hundred of the shortlegged people to make a
livelihood by carrying passengers to and from the shore

A dozen sampan men and boys hailed Alf and offered their services He
selected the most favorablelooking one an old and beneficentappearing
man with a withered leg Alf stepped into his sampan and sat down
It was quite dark and he could not see what the old fellow was doing
though he evidently was doing nothing about shoving off and getting
under way At last he limped over and peered into Alfs face

Ten sen he said

Yes I know ten sen Alf answered carelessly But hurry up American
schooner

Ten sen You pay now the old fellow insisted

Alf felt himself grow hot all over at the hateful words pay now You
take me to American schooner then I pay he said

But the man stood up patiently before him held out his hand and said
Ten sen You pay now

Alf tried to explain He had no money He had lost his purse But he
would pay As soon as he got aboard the American schooner then he would
pay No he would not even go aboard the American schooner He would
call to his shipmates and they would give the sampan man the ten sen
first After that he would go aboard So it was all right of course

To all of which the beneficentappearing old man replied You pay now
Ten sen And to make matters worse the other sampan men squatted on
the pier steps listening

Alf chagrined and angry stood up to step ashore But the old fellow
laid a detaining hand on his sleeve You give shirt now I take you
Merican schooner he proposed

Then it was that all of Alfs American independence flamed up in his
breast The AngloSaxon has a born dislike of being imposed upon and
to Alf this was sheer robbery Ten sen was equivalent to six American
cents while his shirt which was of good quality and was new had cost
him two dollars

He turned his back on the man without a word and went out to the end of
the pier the crowd laughing with great gusto following at his heels
The majority of them were heavyset muscular fellows and the July
night being one of sweltering heat they were clad in the least possible
raiment The waterpeople of any race are rough and turbulent and it
struck Alf that to be out at midnight on a pierend with such a crowd of
wharfmen in a big Japanese city was not as safe as it might be

One burly fellow with a shock of black hair and ferocious eyes came
up The rest shoved in after him to take part in the discussion

Give me shoes the man said Give me shoes now I take you Merican
schooner

Alf shook his head whereat the crowd clamored that he accept the
proposal Now the AngloSaxon is so constituted that to browbeat or
bully him is the last way under the sun of getting him to do any certain
thing He will dare willingly but he will not permit himself to be
driven So this attempt of the boatmen to force Alf only aroused all the
dogged stubbornness of his race The same qualities were in him that are
in men who lead forlorn hopes and there under the stars on the lonely
pier encircled by the jostling and shouldering gang he resolved that
he would die rather than submit to the indignity of being robbed of a
single stitch of clothing Not value but principle was at stake

Then somebody thrust roughly against him from behind He whirled about
with flashing eyes and the circle involuntarily gave ground But the
crowd was growing more boisterous Each and every article of clothing he
had on was demanded by one or another and these demands were shouted
simultaneously at the tops of very healthy lungs

Alf had long since ceased to say anything but he knew that the
situation was getting dangerous and that the only thing left to him
was to get away His face was set doggedly his eyes glinted like points
of steel and his body was firmly and confidently poised This air of
determination sufficiently impressed the boatmen to make them give way
before him when he started to walk toward the shoreend of the pier But
they trooped along beside him and behind him shouting and laughing more
noisily than ever One of the youngsters about Alfs size and build
impudently snatched his cap from his head but before he could put it on
his own head Alf struck out from the shoulder and sent the fellow
rolling on the stones

The cap flew out of his hand and disappeared among the many legs Alf
did some quick thinking his sailor pride would not permit him to leave
the cap in their hands He followed in the direction it had sped and
soon found it under the bare foot of a stalwart fellow who kept his
weight stolidly upon it Alf tried to get the cap out by a sudden jerk
but failed He shoved against the mans leg but the man only grunted
It was challenge direct and Alf accepted it Like a flash one leg was
behind the man and Alf had thrust strongly with his shoulder against the
fellows chest Nothing could save the man from the fierce vigorousness
of the trick and he was hurled over and backward

Next the cap was on Alfs head and his fists were up before him Then
he whirled about to prevent attack from behind and all those in that
quarter fled precipitately This was what he wanted None remained
between him and the shore end The pier was narrow Facing them and
threatening with his fist those who attempted to pass him on either
side he continued his retreat It was exciting work walking backward
and at the same time checking that surging mass of men But the
darkskinned peoples the world over have learned to respect the white
mans fist and it was the battles fought by many sailors more than his
own warlike front that gave Alf the victory

Where the pier adjoins the shore was the station of the harbor police
and Alf backed into the electriclighted office very much to the
amusement of the dapper lieutenant in charge The sampan men grown
quiet and orderly clustered like flies by the open door through which
they could see and hear what passed

Alf explained his difficulty in few words and demanded as the
privilege of a stranger in a strange land that the lieutenant put him
aboard in the policeboat The lieutenant in turn who knew all the
rules and regulations by heart explained that the harbor police were
not ferrymen and that the policeboats had other functions to perform
than that of transporting belated and penniless sailormen to their
ships He also said he knew the sampan men to be naturalborn robbers
but that so long as they robbed within the law he was powerless It
was their right to collect fares in advance and who was he to command
them to take a passenger and collect fare at the journeys end Alf
acknowledged the justice of his remarks but suggested that while he
could not command he might persuade The lieutenant was willing to
oblige and went to the door from where he delivered a speech to the
crowd But they too knew their rights and when the officer had
finished shouted in chorus their abominable Ten sen You pay now
You pay now

You see I can do nothing said the lieutenant who by the way spoke
perfect English But I have warned them not to harm or molest you so
you will be safe at least The night is warm and half over Lie down
somewhere and go to sleep I would permit you to sleep here in the
office were it not against the rules and regulations

Alf thanked him for his kindness and courtesy but the sampan men had
aroused all his pride of race and doggedness and the problem could not
be solved that way To sleep out the night on the stones was an
acknowledgment of defeat

The sampan men refuse to take me out

The lieutenant nodded

And you refuse to take me out

Again the lieutenant nodded

Well then its not in the rules and regulations that you can prevent
my taking myself out

The lieutenant was perplexed There is no boat he said

Thats not the question Alf proclaimed hotly If I take myself out
everybodys satisfied and no harm done

Yes what you say is true persisted the puzzled lieutenant But you
cannot take yourself out

You just watch me was the retort

Down went Alfs cap on the office floor Right and left he kicked off
his lowcut shoes Trousers and shirt followed

Remember he said in ringing tones I as a citizen of the United
States shall hold you the city of Yokohama and the government of
Japan responsible for those clothes Good night

He plunged through the doorway scattering the astounded boatmen to
either side and ran out on the pier But they quickly recovered and ran
after him shouting with glee at the new phase the situation had taken
on It was a night long remembered among the waterfolk of Yokohama
town Straight to the end Alf ran and without pause dived off cleanly
and neatly into the water He struck out with a lusty singleoverhand
stroke till curiosity prompted him to halt for a moment Out of the
darkness from where the pier should be voices were calling to him

He turned on his back floated and listened

All right All right he could distinguish from the babel No pay
now pay bime by Come back Come back now pay bime by

No thank you he called back No pay at all Good night

Then he faced about in order to locate the Annie Mine She was
fully a mile away and in the darkness it was no easy task to get her
bearings First he settled upon a blaze of lights which he knew nothing
but a manofwar could make That must be the United States warship
Lancaster Somewhere to the left and beyond should be the
Annie Mine But to the left he made out three lights close
together That could not be the schooner For the moment he was
confused He rolled over on his back and shut his eyes striving to
construct a mental picture of the harbor as he had seen it in daytime
With a snort of satisfaction he rolled back again The three lights
evidently belonged to the big English tramp steamer Therefore the
schooner must lie somewhere between the three lights and the
Lancaster He gazed long and steadily and there very dim and
low but at the point he expected burned a single lightthe
anchorlight of the Annie Mine

And it was a fine swim under the starshine The air was warm as the
water and the water as warm as tepid milk The good salt taste of it
was in his mouth the tingling of it along his limbs and the steady
beat of his heart heavy and strong made him glad for living

But beyond being glorious the swim was uneventful On the right hand he
passed the manylighted Lancaster on the left hand the English
tramp and ere long the Annie Mine loomed large above him He
grasped the hanging ropeladder and drew himself noiselessly on deck
There was no one in sight He saw a light in the galley and knew that
the captains son who kept the lonely anchorwatch was making coffee
Alf went forward to the forecastle The men were snoring in their bunks
and in that confined space the heat seemed to him insufferable So he
put on a thin cotton shirt and a pair of dungaree trousers tucked
blanket and pillow under his arm and went up on deck and out on the
forecastlehead

Hardly had he begun to doze when he was roused by a boat coming
alongside and hailing the anchorwatch It was the policeboat and to
Alf it was given to enjoy the excited conversation that ensued Yes the
captains son recognized the clothes They belonged to Alf Davis one of
the seamen What had happened No Alf Davis had not come aboard He
was ashore He was not ashore Then he must be drowned Here both the
lieutenant and the captains son talked at the same time and Alf could
make out nothing Then he heard them come forward and rouse out the
crew The crew grumbled sleepily and said that Alf Davis was not in the
forecastle whereupon the captains son waxed indignant at the Yokohama
police and their ways and the lieutenant quoted rules and regulations
in despairing accents

Alf rose up from the forecastlehead and extended his hand saying

I guess Ill take those clothes Thank you for bringing them aboard so
promptly

I dont see why he couldnt have brought you aboard inside of them
said the captains son

And the police lieutenant said nothing though he turned the clothes
over somewhat sheepishly to their rightful owner

The next day when Alf started to go ashore he found himself surrounded
by shouting and gesticulating though very respectful sampan men all
extraordinarily anxious to have him for a passenger Nor did the one
he selected say You pay now when he entered his boat When Alf
prepared to step out on to the pier he offered the man the customary
ten sen But the man drew himself up and shook his head

You all right he said You no pay You never no pay You bully boy
and all right

And for the rest of the Annie Mines stay in port the sampan men
refused money at Alf Daviss hand Out of admiration for his pluck and
independence they had given him the freedom of the harbor




WHOSE BUSINESS IS TO LIVE


Stanton Davies and Jim Wemple ceased from their talk to listen to an
increase of uproar in the street A volley of stones thrummed and boomed
the wire mosquito nettings that protected the windows It was a hot
night and the sweat of the heat stood on their faces as they listened
Arose the incoherent clamor of the mob punctuated by individual cries
in MexicanSpanish Least terrible among the obscene threats were
Death to the Gringos Kill the American pigs Drown the American
dogs in the sea

Stanton Davies and Jim Wemple shrugged their shoulders patiently to each
other and resumed their conversation talking louder in order to make
themselves heard above the uproar

The question is how Wemple said Its fortyseven miles to
Panuco by river

And the lands impossible with Zaragozas and Villas men on the loot
and maybe fraternizing Davies agreed

Wemple nodded and continued And shes at the East Coast Magnolia two
miles beyond if she isnt back at the hunting camp Weve got to get
her

Weve played pretty square in this matter Wemple Davies said And
we might as well speak up and acknowledge what each of us knows the
other knows You want her I want her

Wemple lighted a cigarette and nodded

And nows the time when its up to us to make a show as if we didnt
want her and that all we want is just to save her and get her down
here

And a truce until we do save herI get you Wempel affirmed

A truce until we get her safe and sound back here in Tampico or aboard
a battleship After that 

Both men shrugged shoulders and beamed on each other as their hands met
in ratification

Fresh volleys of stones thrummed against the wirescreened windows a
boys voice rose shrilly above the clamor proclaiming death to the
Gringos and the house reverberated to the heavy crash of some battering
ram against the streetdoor downstairs Both men snatching up automatic
rifles ran down to where their fire could command the threatened door

If they break in weve got to let them have it Wemple said

Davies nodded quiet agreement then inconsistently burst out with a
lurid string of oaths

To think of it he explained his wrath One out of three of those
curs outside has worked for you or meleanbellied barefooted
povertystricken glad for ten centavos a day if they could only get
work And weve given them steady jobs and a hundred and fifty centavos
a a day and here they are yelling for our blood

Only the half breeds Davies corrected

You know what I mean Wemple replied The only peons weve lost are
those that have been run off or shot

The attack on the door ceasing they returned upstairs Half a dozen
scattered shots from farther along the street seemed to draw away the
mob for the neighborhood became comparatively quiet

A whistle came to them through the open windows and a mans voice
calling

Wemple Open the door Its Habert Want to talk to you

Wemple went down returning in several minutes with a tidilypaunched
wellbuilt grayhaired American of fifty He shook hands with Davies
and flung himself into a chair breathing heavily He did not relinquish
his clutch on the Colts  automatic pistol although he immediately
addressed himself to the task of fishing a filled clip of cartridges
from the pocket of his linen coat He had arrived hatless and
breathless and the blood from a stonecut on the cheek oozed down his
face He too in a fit of anger springing to his feet when he had
changed clips in his pistol burst out with mouthfilling profanity

They had an American flag in the dirt stamping and spitting on it And
they told me to spit on it

Wemple and Davies regarded him with silent interrogation

Oh I know what youre wondering he flared out Would I aspit on it
in the pinch Thats whats eating you Ill answer Straight out brass
tacks I WOULD Put that in your pipe and smoke it

He paused to help himself to a cigar from the box on the table and to
light it with a steady and defiant hand

HellI guess this neck of the woods knows Anthony Habert and you can
bank on it that its never located his yellow streak Sure in the
pinch Id spit on Old Glory What the hell dye think Im going on the
streets for a night like this Didnt I skin out of the Southern Hotel
half an hour ago where there are forty buck Americans not counting
their women and all armed That was safety What dye think I came here
forto rescue you

His indignation lumped his throat into silence and he seemed shaken as
with an apoplexy

Spit it out Davies commanded dryly

Ill tell you Habert exploded Its Billy Boy Fifty miles up
country and twentythousand throatcutting federals and rebels between
him and me Dye know what that boyd do if he was here in Tampico and
I was fifty miles up the Panuco Well I know And Im going to do the
samego and get him

Were figuring on going up Wemple assured him

And thats why I headed hereMiss Drexel of course

Both men acquiesced and smiled It was a time when men dared speak of
matters which at other times tabooed speech

Then the things to get started Habert exclaimed looking at his
watch Its midnight now Weve got to get to the river and get a
boat

But the clamor of the returning mob came through the windows in answer

Davies was about to speak when the telephone rang and Wemple sprang to
the instrument

Its Carson he interjected as he listened They havent cut the
wires across the river yetHello Carson Was it a break or a cut 
Bully for you Yes move the mules across to the potrero beyond
Tamcochin Whos at the water station  Can you still phone
him  Tell him to keep the tanks full and to shut off the main to
Arico Also to hang on till the last minute and keep a horse saddled
to cut and run for it Last thing before he runs he must jerk out the
phone Yes yes yes Sure No breeds Leave fullblooded Indians in
charge Gabriel is a good hombre Heaven knows once were chased
out when well get back You cant pinch down Jaramillo under
twentyfive hundred barrels Weve got storage for ten days Gabrielll
have to handle it Keep it moving if we have to run it into the
river

Ask him if he has a launch Habert broke in

He hasnt was Wemples answer The federals commandeered the last
one at noon

Say Carson how are you going to make your getaway Wemple queried

The man to whom he talked was across the Panuco on the south side at
the tank farm

Says there isnt any getaway Wemple vouchsafed to the other two
The federals are all over the shop and he cant understand why they
havent raided him hours ago

 Who Campos That skunk  all right Dont be worried if you
dont hear from me Im going up river with Davies and Habert Use
your judgment and if you get a safe chance at Campos pot him Oh
a hot time over here Theyre battering our doors now Yes by all
means  Goodby old man

Wemple lighted a cigarette and wiped his forehead

You know Campos Jos H Campos he
volunteered The dirty curs stuck Carson up
for twenty thousand pesos We had to pay
or hed have compelled half our peons to enlist
or set the wells on fire And you know
Davies what weve done for him in past years
Gratitude Simple decency Great Scott

                                   

It was the night of April twentyfirst On the morning of the
twentyfirst the American marines and bluejackets had landed at Vera
Cruz and seized the custom house and the city Immediately the news was
telegraphed the vengeful Mexican mob had taken possession of the
streets of Tampico and expressed its disapproval of the action of the
United States by tearing down American flags and crying death to the
Americans

There was nothing save its own spinelessness to deter the mob from
carrying out its threat Had it battered down the doors of the Southern
Hotel or of other hotels or of residences such as Wemples a fight
would have started in which the thousands of federal soldiers in Tampico
would have joined their civilian compatriots in the laudable task of
decreasing the Gringo population of that particular portion of Mexico
There should have been American warships to act as deterrents but
through some inexplicable excess of delicacy or strategy or heaven
knows what the United States when it gave its orders to take Vera
Cruz had very carefully withdrawn its warships from Tampico to the open
Gulf a dozen miles away This order had come to Admiral Mayo by wireless
from Washington and thrice he had demanded the order to be repeated
ere with tears in his eyes he had turned his back on his countrymen
and countrywomen and steamed to sea

                                   

Of all asinine things to leave us in the lurch this way Habert was
denouncing the powers that be of his country Mayod never have done
it Mark my words he had to take program from Washington And here we
are and our dear ones scattered for fifty miles back up country
Say if I lose Billy Boy Ill never dare go home to face the wifeCome
on Let the three of us make a start We can throw the fear of God into
any gang on the streets

Come on over and take a squint Davies invited from where he stood
somewhat back from the window looking down into the street

It was gorged with rioters all haranguing cursing crying out death
and urging one another to smash the doors but each hanging back from
the death he knew waited behind those doors for the first of the rush

We cant break through a bunch like that Habert was Davies comment

And if we die under their feet well be of little use to Billy Boy or
anybody else up the Panuco Wemple added And if

A new movement of the mob caused him to break off It was splitting
before a slow and silent advance of a file of whiteclad men

BluejacketsMayos come back for us after all Habert muttered

Then we can get a navy launch Davies said

The bedlam of the mob died away and in silence the sailors reached
the street door and knocked for admittance All three went down to open
it and to discover that the callers were not Americans but two German
lieutenants and half a dozen German marines At sight of the Americans
the rage of the mob rose again and was quelled by the grounding of the
rifle butts of the marines

No thank you the senior lieutenant in passable English declined
the invitation to enter He unconcernedly kept his cigar alive at such
times that the mob drowned his voice We are on the way back to our
ship Our commander conferred with the English and Dutch commanders but
they declined to cooperate so our commander has undertaken the entire
responsibility We have been the round of the hotels They are to hold
their own until daybreak when well take them off We have given them
rockets such as theseTake them If your house is entered hold your
own and send up a rocket from the roof We can be here in force in
fortyfive minutes Steam is up in all our launches launch crews and
marines for shore duty are in the launches and at the first rocket we
shall start

Since you are going aboard now we should like to go with you Davies
said after having rendered due thanks

The surprise and distaste on both lieutenants faces was patent

Oh no Davies laughed We dont want refuge We have friends fifty
miles up river and we want to get to the river in order to go up after
them

The pleasure on the officers faces was immediate as they looked a
silent conference at each other

Since our commander has undertaken grave responsibility on a night like
this may we do less than take minor responsibility queried the elder

To this the younger heartily agreed In a trice upstairs and down
again equipped with extra ammunition extra pistols and a
pocketbulging supply of cigars cigarettes and matches the three
Americans were ready Wemple called last instructions up the stairway to
imaginary occupants being left behind ascertained that the spring lock
was on and slammed the door

The officers led followed by the Americans the rear brought up by the
six marines and the spitting howling mob not daring to cast a stone
gave way before them

                                   

As they came alongside the gangway of the cruiser they saw launches and
barges lying in strings to the boatbooms filled with men waiting for
the rocket signal from the beleaguered hotels A gun thundered from
close at hand up river followed by the thunder of numerous guns and
the reports of many rifles fired very rapidly

Now whats the Topila whanging away at Habert complained then
joined the others in gazing at the picture

A searchlight evidently emanating from the Mexican gunboat was
stabbing the darkness to the middle of the river where it played upon
the water And across the water the center of the moving circle of
light flashed a long lean speedboat A shell burst in the air a
hundred feet astern of it Somewhere outside the light other shells
were bursting in the water for they saw the boat rocked by the waves
from the explosions They could guess the whizzing of the rifle bullets

But for only several minutes the spectacle lasted Such was the speed of
the boat that it gained shelter behind the German when the Mexican
gunboat was compelled to cease fire The speedboat slowed down turned
in a wide and heeling circle and ranged up alongside the launch at the
gangway

The lights from the gangway showed but one occupant a towheaded
greasyfaced blond youth of twenty very lean very calm very much
satisfied with himself

If it aint Peter Tonsburg Habert ejaculated reaching out a hand to
shake Howdy Peter howdy And where in hell are you hellbent for
surging by the Topila in such scandalous fashion

Peter a Texasborn Swede of immigrant parents filled with the old
Texas traditions greasily shook hands with Wemple and Davies as well
saying Howdy as only the Texan born can say it

Me he answered Habert I aint hellbent nowhere exceptin to get
away from the shellfire Shes a caution that Topila Huh but
I limbered em up some I was goin every inch of twentyfive They was
like amateurs blazin away at canvasback

Which Chill is it Wemple asked

Chill II Peter answered Its all thats left Chill I
a Greaseryou know mCamposcommandeered this noon I was runnin
Chill III when they caught me at sundown Made me come in under
their guns at the East Coast outfit and fired me out on my neck

Now the bossd gone over in this one to Tampico in the early evening
and just about ten minutes ago I spots it landin with a sousy bunch of
Federals at the East Coast and swipes it back according Wheres the
boss He aint hurt is he Because Im going after him

No youre not Peter Davies said Mr Frisbie is safe at the
Southern Hotel all except a fiveinch scalp wound from a brick thats
got him down with a splitting headache Hes safe so youre going with
us going to take us I mean up beyond Panuco town

HuhI can see myself Peter retorted wiping his greasy nose on a
wad of greasy cotton waste I got some cold Besides this
nightdrivin aint good for my complexion

My boys up there Habert said

Well hes biggern I am and I reckon he can take care of himself

And theres a woman thereMiss Drexel Davies said quietly

Who Miss Drexel Why didnt you say so at first Peter demanded
grievedly He sighed and added Well climb in an make a start Better
get your Dutch friends to donate me about twenty gallons of gasoline if
you want to get anywhere

                                   

Wont do you no good to lay low Peter Tonsburg remarked as at full
speed headed up river the Topilas searchlight stabbed them
High or low if one of them shells hits in the vicinitygood
night

Immediately thereafter the Topila erupted The roar of the
Chills exhaust nearly drowned the roar of the guns but the
fragile hull of the craft was shaken and rocked by the bursting shells
An occasional bullet thudded into or pinged off the Chill and
despite Peters warning that high or low they were bound to get it if
it came to them every man on board including Peter crouched with
chest contracted by drawnin shoulders in an instinctive and purely
unconscious effort to lessen the area of body he presented as a target
or receptacle for flying fragments of steel

The Topila was a federal gunboat To complicate the affair the
constitutionalists gathered on the north shore in the siege of Tampico
opened up on the speedboat with many rifles and a machine gun

Lord Im glad theyre Mexicans and not Americans Habert observed
after five mad minutes in which no damage had been received Mexicans
are born with guns in their hands and they never learn to use them

Nor was the Chill or any man aboard damaged when at last she
rounded the bend of river that shielded her from the searchlight

Ill have you in Panuco town in lessn three hours  if we dont hit
a log Peter leaned back and shouted in Wemples ear And if we do hit
driftwood Ill have you in the swim quicker than that

Chill II tore her way through the darkness steered by the
towheaded youth who knew every foot of the river and who guided his
course by the loom of the banks in the dim starlight A smart breeze
kicking up spiteful wavelets on the wider reaches splashed them with
sheeted water as well as fineflung spray And in the face of the
warmth of the tropic night the wind added to the speed of the boat
chilled them through their wet clothes

Now I know why she was named the Chill Habert observed betwixt
chattering teeth

But conversation languished during the nearly three hours of drive
through the darkness Once by the exhaust they knew that they passed
an unlighted launch bound down stream And once a glare of light near
the south bank as they passed through the Toreno field aroused brief
debate as to whether it was the Toreno wells or the bungalow on
Merricks banana plantation that flared so fiercely

At the end of an hour Peter slowed down and ran in to the bank

I got a cache of gasoline hereten gallons he explained and its
just as well to know its here for the back trip Without leaving the
boat fishing armdeep into the brush he announced All hunkydory
He proceeded to oil the engine Huh he soliloquized for their
benefit I was just readin a magazine yarn last night Whose Business
Is to Die was its title An all I got to say is The hell it is A
mans business is to live Maybe you thought it was our business to die
when the Topila was pepperin us But you was wrong Were
alive aint we We beat her to it Thats the game Nobodys got any
business to die I aint never goin to die if Ive got any say about
it

He turned over the crank and the roar and rush of the Chill put
an end to speech

There was no need for Wemple or Davies to speak further in the affair
closest to their hearts Their truce to lovemaking had been made as
binding as it was brief and each rival honored the other with a firm
belief that he would commit no infraction of the truce Afterward was
another matter In the meantime they were one in the effort to get Beth
Drexel back to the safety of riotous Tampico or of a war vessel

It was four oclock when they passed by Panuco Town Shouts and songs
told them that the federal detachment holding the place was celebrating
its indignation at the landing of American bluejackets in Vera Cruz
Sentinels challenged the Chill from the shore and shot at random
at the noise of her in the darkness

A mile beyond where a lighted river steamer with steam up lay at the
north bank they ran in at the Apshodel wells The steamer was small
and the nearly two hundred Americansmen women and childrencrowded
her capacity Blasphemous greetings of pure joy and geniality were
exchanged between the men and Habert learned that the steamboat was
waiting for his Billy Boy who astride a horse was rounding up
isolated drilling gangs who had not yet learned that the United States
had seized Vera Cruz and that all Mexico was boiling

Habert climbed out to wait and to go down on the steamer while the
three that remained on the Chill having learned that Miss Drexel
was not with the refugees headed for the Dutch Company on the south
shore This was the big gusher pinched down from one hundred and
eightyfive thousand daily barrels to the quantity the company
was able to handle Mexico had no quarrel with Holland so that the
superintendent while up with night guards out to prevent drunken
soldiers from firing his vast lakes of oil was quite unemotional Yes
the last he had heard was that Miss Drexel and her brother were back at
the hunting lodge No he had not sent any warnings and he doubted that
anybody else had Not till ten oclock the previous evening had he
learned of the landing at Vera Cruz The Mexicans had turned nasty as
soon as they heard of it and they had killed Miles Forman at the Empire
Wells run off his labor and looted the camp Horses No he didnt
have horse or mule on the place The federals had commandeered the last
animal weeks back It was his belief however that there were a couple
of plugs at the lodge too worthless even for the Mexicans to take

Its a hike Davies said cheerfully

Six miles of it Wemple agreed equally cheerfully Lets beat it

A shot from the river where they had left Peter in the boat started
them on the run for the bank A scattering of shots as from two rifles
followed And while the Dutch superintendent in execrable Spanish
shouted affirmations of Dutch neutrality into the menacing dark across
the gunwale of Chill II they found the body of the towheaded
youth whose business it had been not to die

                                   

For the first hour talking little Davies and Wemple stumbled along the
apology for a road that led through the jungle to the lodge They did
discuss the glares of several fires to the east along the south bank of
Panuco River and hoped fervently that they were dwellings and not
wells

Two billion dollars worth of oil right here in the Ebao field alone
Davies grumbled

And a drunken Mexican whose whole carcass and immortal soul arent
worth ten pesos including hair hide and tallow can start the bonfire
with a lighted wad of cotton waste was Wemples contribution And if
ever she starts shell gut the field of its last barrel

Dawn at five enabled them to accelerate their pace and six oclock
found them routing out the occupants of the lodge

Dress for rough travel and dont stop for any frills Wemple called
around the corner of Miss Drexels screened sleeping porch

Not a wash nothing Davies supplemented grimly as he shook hands
with Charley Drexel who yawned and slippered up to them in pajamas
Where are those horses Charley Still alive

Wemple finished giving orders to the sleepy peons to remain and care for
the place occupying their spare time with hiding the more valuable
things and was calling around the corner to Miss Drexel the news of the
capture of Vera Cruz when Davies returned with the information that the
horses consisted of a pair of motheaten skates that could be depended
upon to lie down and die in the first half mile

Beth Drexel emerged first protesting that under no circumstances would
she be guilty of riding the creatures and next her brunette skin and
dark eyes still flushed warm with sleep greeting the two rescuers

It would be just as well if you washed your face Stanton she told
Davies and to Wemple Youre just as bad Jim You are a pair of
dirty boys

And so will you be Wemple assured her before you get back to
Tampico Are you ready

As soon as Juanita packs my hand bag

Heavens Beth dont waste time exclaimed Wemple Jump in and grab
up what you want

Make a startmake a start chanted Davies Hustle HustleCharley
get the rifle you like best and take it along Get a couple for us

Is it as serious as that Miss Drexel queried

Both men nodded

The Mexicans are tearing loose Davies explained How they missed
this place I dont know A movement in the adjoining room startled him
Whos that he cried

Why Mrs Morgan Miss Drexel answered

Good heavens Wemple Id forgotten her groaned Davies How
will we ever get her anywhere

Let Beth walk and relay the lady on the nags

She weighs a hundred and eighty Miss Drexel laughed Oh hurry
Martha Were waiting on you to start

Muffled speech came through the partition and then emerged a very
short stout muchflustered woman of middle age

I simply cant walk and you boys neednt demand it of me was her
plaint Its no use I couldnt walk half a mile to save my life and
its six of the worst miles to the river

They regarded her in despair

Then youll ride said Davies Come on Charley Well get a saddle
on each of the nags

Along the road through the tropic jungle Miss Drexel and Juanita
her Indian maid led the way Her brother carrying the three rifles
brought up the rear while in the middle Davies and Wemple struggled
with Mrs Morgan and the two decrepit steeds One a fleabitten roan
groaned continually from the moment Mrs Morgans burden was put upon
him till she was shifted to the other horse And this other a mangy
sorrel invariably lay down at the end of a quarter of a mile of Mrs
Morgan

Miss Drexel laughed and joked and encouraged and Wemple in brutal
fashion compelled Mrs Morgan to walk every third quarter of a mile
At the end of an hour the sorrel refused positively to get up and so
was abandoned Thereafter Mrs Morgan rode the roan alternate quarters
of miles and between times walkedif walk may describe her
stumbling progress on two preposterously tiny feet with a man supporting
her on either side

A mile from the river the road became more civilized running along the
side of a thousand acres of banana plantation

Parslows young Drexel said Hell lose a years crop now on account
of this mixup

Oh look what Ive found Miss Drexel called from the lead

First machine that ever tackled this road was young Drexels
judgment as they halted to stare at the tiretracks

But look at the tracks his sister urged The machine must have come
right out of the bananas and climbed the bank

Some machine to climb a bank like that was Davies comment What it
did do was to go down the banktake a scout after it Charley while
Wemple and I get Mrs Morgan off her fractious mount No machine ever
built could travel far through those bananas

The fleabitten roan on its four legs upstanding continued bravely to
stand until the lady was removed whereupon with a long sigh it sank
down on the ground Mrs Morgan likewise sighed sat down and regarded
her tiny feet mournfully

Go on boys she said Maybe you can find something at the river and
send back for me

But their indignant rejection of the plan never attained speech for at
that instant from the green sea of banana trees beneath them came the
sudden purr of an engine A minute later the splutter of an exhaust told
them the silencer had been taken off The hugefronded banana trees were
violently agitated as by the threshing of a hidden Titan They could
identify the changing of gears and the reversing and going ahead until
at the end of five minutes a long low black car burst from the wall of
greenery and charged the soft earth bank but the earth was too soft
and when twothirds of the way up beaten Charley Drexel braked the
car to a standstill the earth crumbled from under the tires and he ran
it down and back the way he had come until halfburied in the bananas

A Merry Oldsmobile Miss Drexel quoted from the popular song
clapping her hands Now Martha your troubles are over

Sixcylinder and sounds as if it hadnt been out of the shop a week
or may I never ride in a machine again Wemple remarked looking to
Davies for confirmation

Davies nodded

Its Allisons he said Campos tried to shake him down for a private
loan andwell you know Allison He told Campos to go to And Campos
in revenge commandeered his new car That was two days ago before we
lifted a hand at Vera Cruz Allison told me yesterday the last hed
heard of the car it was on a steamboat bound up river And heres where
they ditched itbut lets get a hustle on and get her into the
running

Three attempts they made with young Drexel at the wheel but the soft
earth and the pitch of the grade baffled

Shes got the power all right young Drexel protested But she cant
bite into that mush

So far they had spread on the ground the robes found in the car
The men now added their coats and Wemple for additional traction
unsaddled the roan and spread the cinches stirrup leathers saddle
blanket and bridle in the way of the wheels The car took the
treacherous slope in a rush with churning wheels biting into the woven
fabrics and with no more than a hint of hesitation it cleared the
crest and swung into the road

Isnt she the spunky devil Drexel exulted Say she could climb the
side of a house if she could get traction

Better put on that silencer again if you dont want to play tag with
every soldier in the district Wemple ordered as they helped Mrs
Morgan in

The road to the Dutch gusher compelled them to go through the outskirts
of Panuco town Indian and half breed women gazed stolidly at the
strange vehicle while the children and barking dogs clamorously
advertised its progress Once passing long lines of tethered federal
horses they were challenged by a sentry but at Wemples Throw on the
juice the car took the rutted road at fifty miles an hour A shot
whistled after them But it was not the shot that made Mrs Morgan
scream The cause was a series of hogwallows masked with mud which
nearly tore the steering wheel from Drexels hands before he could
reduce speed

Wonder it didnt break an axle Davies growled Go on and take it
easy Charley Were past any interference

They swung into the Dutch camp and into the beginning of their real
troubles The refugee steamboat had departed down river from the
Asphodel camp Chill II had disappeared the superintendent knew
not how along with the body of Peter Tonsburg and the superintendent
was dubious of their remaining

Ive got to consider the owners he told them This is the biggest
well in Mexico and you know ita hundred and eightyfive thousand
barrels daily flow Ive no right to risk it We have no trouble with
the Mexicans Its you Americans If you stay here Ill have to protect
you And I cant protect you anyway Well all lose our lives and
theyll destroy the well in the bargain And if they fire it it means
the entire Ebao oil field The stratas too broken Were flowing
twenty thousand barrels now and we cant pinch down any further As it
is the oils coming up outside the pipe And we cant have a fight
Weve got to keep the oil moving

The men nodded It was coldblooded logic but there was no fault to it

The harassed expression eased on the superintendents face and he
almost beamed on them for agreeing with him

Youve got a good machine there he continued The ferrys at the
bank at Panuco and once youre across the rebels arent so thick on
the north shore Why you can beat the steamboat back to Tampico by
hours And it hasnt rained for days The road wont be at all bad

                                   

Which is all very good Davies observed to Wemple as they approached
Panuco except for the fact that the road on the other side was never
built for automobiles much less for a longbodied one like this I wish
it were the Four instead of the Six

And it would bother you with a Four to negotiate that hill at Aliso
where the road switchbacks above the river

And were going to do it with a Six or lose a perfectly good Six in
trying Beth Drexel laughed to them

Avoiding the cavalry camp they entered Panuco with all the speed the
ruts permitted swinging dizzy corners to the squawking of chickens and
barking of dogs To gain the ferry they had to pass down one side of
the great plaza which was the heart of the city Peon soldiers drowsing
in the sun or clustering around the cantinas stared stupidly at
them as they flashed past Then a drunken major shouted a challenge from
the doorway of a cantina and began vociferating orders and as
they left the plaza behind they could hear rising the familiar mobcry
Kill the Gringoes

If any shooting begins you women get down in the bottom of the car
Davies commanded And theres the ferry all right Be careful
Charley

The machine plunged directly down the bank through a cut so deep that it
was more like a chute struck the gangplank with a terrific bump and
seemed fairly to leap on board The ferry was scarcely longer than the
machine and Drexel visibly shaken by the closeness of the shave
managed to stop only when six inches remained between the front wheels
and overboard

It was a cable ferry operated by gasoline and while Wemple cast off
the mooring lines Davies was making swift acquaintance with the engine
The third turnover started it and he threw it into gear with the
windlass that began winding up the cable from the rivers bottom

By the time they were in midstream a score of horsemen rode out on the
bank they had just left and opened a scattering fire The party crowded
in the shelter of the car and listened to the occasional richochet of a
bullet Once only the car was struck

Herewhat are you up to Wemple demanded suddenly of Drexel who had
exposed himself to fish a rifle out of the car

Going to show the skunks what shooting is was his answer

No you dont Wemple said Were not here to fight but to get
this party to Tampico He remembered Peter Tonsburgs remark Whose
business is to live Charleythats our business Anybody can get
killed Its too easy these days

Still under fire they moored at the north shore and when Davies had
tossed overboard the igniter from the ferry engine and commandeered ten
gallons of its surplus gasoline they took the steep soft road up the
bank in a rush

Look at her climb Drexel uttered gleefully That Aliso hill wont
bother us at all Shell put a crimp in it thats what shell do

It isnt the hill its the sharp turn of the zigzag thats liable to
put a crimp in her Davies answered That road was never laid out for
autos and no auto has ever been over it They steamboated this one up

But trouble came before Aliso was reached Where the road dipped
abruptly into a small jag of hollow that was almost Vshaped it arose
out and became a hundred yards of deep sand In order to have speed left
for the sand after he cleared the stiff upgrade of the V Drexel was
compelled to hit the trough of the V with speed Wemple clutched Miss
Drexel as she was on the verge of being bounced out Mrs Morgan too
solid for such airiness screamed from the pain of the bump and even
the imperturbable Juanita fell to crossing herself and uttering prayers
with exceeding rapidity

The car cleared the crest and encountered the sand going slower from
moment to moment slewing and writhing and squirming from side to side
The men leaped out and began shoving Miss Drexel urged Juanita out and
followed But the car came to a standstill and Drexel looking back and
pointing showed the first sign of being beaten Two things he pointed
to a constitutional soldier on horseback a quarter of a mile in the
rear and a portion of the narrow road that had fallen out bodily on the
far slope of the V

Cant get at this sand unless we go back and try over and we ditch the
car if we try to back up that

The ditch was a huge natural sumphole the stagnant surface of which
was acrawl with slime twenty feet beneath

Davies and Wemple sprang to take the boys place

You cant do it he urged You can get the back wheels past but
right there you hit that little curve and if you make it your front
wheel will be off the bank If you dont make it your back wheelll be
off

Both men studied it carefully then looked at each other

Weve got to said Davies

And were going to Wemple said shoving his rival aside in comradely
fashion and taking the post of danger at the wheel Youre just as good
as I at the wheel Davies he explained But youre a better shot
Your jobs cut out to go back and hold off any Greasers that show up

Davies took a rifle and strolled back with so ominous an air that the
lone cavalryman put spurs to his horse and fled Mrs Morgan was helped
out and sent plodding and tottering unaided on her way to the end of the
sand stretch Miss Drexel and Juanita joined Charley in spreading the
coats and robes on the sand and in gathering and spreading small
branches brush and armfuls of a dry brittle shrub But all three
ceased from their exertions to watch Wemple as he shot the car backward
down the V and up The car seemed first to stand on one end then on the
other and to reel drunkenly and to threaten to turn over into the
sumphole when its right front wheel fell into the air where the road
had ceased to be But the hind wheels bit and climbed the grade and out

Without pause gathering speed down the perilous slope Wemple came
ahead and up gaining fifty feet of sand over the previous failure More
of the alluvial soil of the road had dropped out at the bad place but
he took the V in reverse overhung the front wheel as before and from
the top came ahead again Four times he did this gaining each time but
each time knocking a bigger hole where the road fell out until Miss
Drexel begged him not to try again

He pointed to a squad of horsemen coming at a gallop along the road a
mile in the rear and took the V once again in reverse

If only we had more stuff Drexel groaned to his sister as he threw
down a meager hardgathered armful of the dry and brittle shrub and as
Wemple once more with rush and roar shot down the V

For an instant it seemed that the great car would turn over into the
sump but the next instant it was past It struck the bottom of the
hollow a mighty wallop and bounced and upended to the steep pitch of
the climb Miss Drexel seized by inspiration or desperation with a
quick movement stripped off her short corduroy trampingskirt and
looking very lithe and boyish in slendercut pongee bloomers ran along
the sand and dropped the skirt for a foothold for the slowly revolving
wheels Almost but not quite did the car stop then gathering way
with the others running alongside and shoving it emerged on the hard
road

While they tossed the robes and coats and Miss Drexels skirt into the
bottom of the car and got Mrs Morgan on board Davies overtook them

Down on the bottomall of you he shouted as he gained the running
board and the machine sprang away A scattering of shots came from the
rear

Whose business is to livehunch down Davies yelled in Wemples ear
accompanying the instruction with an openhanded blow on the shoulder

Live yourself Wemple grumbled as he obediently hunched Get your
head down Youre exposing yourself

The pursuit lasted but a little while and died away in an occasional
distant shot

Theyve quit Davies announced It never entered their stupid heads
that they could have caught us on Aliso Hill

                                   

It cant be done was Charley Drexels quick judgment of youth as the
machine stopped and they surveyed the acuteangled turn on the stiff
upgrade of Aliso Beneath was the swiftrunning river

Get out everybody Wemple commanded Upside all of you if you
dont want the car to turn over on you Spread traction wherever she
needs it

Shoot her ahead or backshe cant stop Davies said quietly from
the outer edge of the road where he had taken position The earths
crumbling away from under the tires every second she stands still

Get out from under or shell be on top of you Wemple ordered as he
went ahead several yards

But again after the car rested a minute the light dry earth began to
crack and crumble away from under the tires rolling in a miniature
avalanche down the steep declivity into the water And not until Wemple
had backed fifty yards down the narrow road did he find solid resting
for the car He came ahead on foot and examined the acute angle formed
by the two zigzags Together with Davies he planned what was to be
done

When you come youve got to come ahumping Davies advised If you
stop anywhere for more than seconds its good night and the walking
wont be fine

Shes full of fight and she can do it See that hard formation right
there on the inside wall It couldnt have come at a better spot If I
dont make her hind wheels climb half way up it well start walking
about a second thereafter

Shes a twofisted piece of machinery Davies encouraged I know her
kind If she cant do it no machine can that was ever made Am I right
Beth

Shes a regular spunky shedevil Miss Drexel laughed agreement And
so are the pair of youerof the male persuasion I mean

Miss Drexel had never seemed so fascinating to either of them as she was
then in the excitement quite unconscious of her abbreviated costume
her brown hair flying her eyes sparkling her lips smiling Each man
caught the other in that moments pause to look and each man sighed to
the other and looked frankly into each others eyes ere he turned to the
work at hand

Wemple came up with his usual rush but it was a gauged rush and Davies
took the post of danger the outside running board where his weight
would help the broad tires to bite a little deeper into the treacherous
surface If the roadedge crumbled away it was inevitable that he would
be caught under the car as it rolled over and down to the river

It was ahead and reverse ahead and reverse with only the briefest of
pauses in which to shift the gears Wemple backed up the hard formation
on the inside bank till the car seemed standing on end rushed ahead
till the earth of the outer edge broke under the front tires and
splashed in the water Davies now off and again on the running board
when needed accompanied the car in its jerky and erratic progress
tossing robes and coats under the tires calling instructions to Drexel
similarly occupied on the other side and warning Miss Drexel out of the
way

Oh you Merry Olds you Merry Olds you Merry Olds Wemple muttered
aloud as if in prayer as he wrestled the car about the narrow area
gaining sometimes inches in pivoting it sometimes fetching back up the
inner wall precisely at the spot previously attained and once having
the car with the surface of the roadbed under it slide bodily and
sidewise two feet down the road

The clapping of Miss Drexels hands was the first warning Davies
received that the feat was accomplished and swinging on to the running
board he found the car backing in the straightaway up the next zigzag
and Wemple still chanting ecstatically Oh you Merry Olds you Merry
Olds

There were no more grades nor zigzags between them and Tampico but so
narrow was the primitive road two miles farther were backed before
space was found in which to turn around One thing of importance
did lie between them and Tampiconamely the investing lines of the
constitutionalists But here at noon fortune favored in the form of
three American soldiers of fortune operators of machine guns who had
fought the entire campaign with Villa from the beginning of the advance
from the Texan border Under a white flag Wemple drove the car across
the zone of debate into the federal lines where good fortune in the
guise of an ubiquitous German naval officer again received them

I think you are nearly the only Americans left in Tampico he told
them About all the rest are lying out in the Gulf on the different
warships But at the Southern Hotel there are several and the situation
seems quieter

As they got out at the Southern Davies laid his hand on the car and
murmured Good old girl Wemple followed suit And Miss Drexel
engaging both mens eyes and about to say something was guilty of a
sudden moisture in her own eyes that made her turn to the car with a
caressing hand and repeat Good old girl
