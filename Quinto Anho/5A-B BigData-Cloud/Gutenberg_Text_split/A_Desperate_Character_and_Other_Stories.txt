WHOSE ART IN ESSENCE OFTEN RECALLS

THE ART AND ESSENCE OF TURGENEV




INTRODUCTION

The six tales now translated for the English reader were written by
Turgenev at various dates between  and  Their chronological
order is


Pyetushkov  

The Brigadier  

A Strange Story  

Punin and Baburin  

Old Portraits  

A Desperate Character  


Pyetushkov is the work of a young man of twentynine and its lively
unstrained realism is so bold intimate and delicate as to contradict
the flattering compliment that the French have paid to one anotherthat
Turgenev had need to dress his art by the aid of French mirrors

Although Pyetushkov shows us by a certain open navet of style
that a youthful hand is at work it is the hand of a young master
carrying out the realism of the fortiesthat of Gogol Balzac and
Dickensstraightway with finer point to find a perfect equilibrium
free from any bias or caricature The whole strength and essence of the
realistic method has been developed in Pyetushkov to its just limits
The Russians are instinctive realists and carry the warmth of life
into their pages which warmth the French seem to lose in clarifying
their impressions and crystallising them in art Pyetushkov is not
exquisite it is irresistible Note how the reader is transported bodily
into Pyetushkovs stuffy room and how the major fairly boils out of the
two pages he lives in pp   That is realism if you like A
woman will see the point of Pyetushkov very quickly Onisim and
Vassilissa and the aunt walk and chatter around the stupid Pyetushkov
and glance at him significantly in a manner that reveals everything
about these peoples world All the servants who appear in the tales in
this volume are hit off so marvellously that one sees the lowerclass
world which is such a mystery to certain refined minds has no secrets
for Turgenev

Of a different and to our taste more fascinating genre is The
Brigadier It is greater art because lifes prosaic growth is revealed
not merely realistically but also poetically life as a tiny part of
the great universe around it The tale is a microcosm of Turgenevs own
nature his love of Nature his tender sympathy for all humble ragged
eccentric despised human creatures his unfaltering keenness of gaze
into character his fine sense of proportion mingle in The
Brigadier to create for us a sense of the pitiableness of mans tiny
life of the mere human seed which springs and spreads a while on earth
and dies under the menacing gaze of the advancing years Out of the
sweetness came forth strength is perhaps the best saying by which one
can define Turgenevs peculiar merits in The Brigadier

Punin and Baburin presents to us again one of those ragged ones one
of the poor in spirit the idealist Punin a character whose portrait
challenges Dostoievskys skill on the latters own ground That
delicious Punin and that terrible grandmothers scene with Baburin How
absolutely Slav is the blending of irony and kindness in the treatment
of Punin Cucumber and Pyetushkov few English readers will understand
All the characters in Punin and Baburin are so strongly drawn so
intensely alive that like Rembrandts portraits they make the living
people who stand looking at them absurdly grey and lifeless by
comparison Baburin is a Nihilist before the times of Nihilism he is a
type of the strong characters that arose later in the movement of the
eighties

A preNihilistic type is also the character of Sophie in A Strange
Story But the chief value of this last psychological study is that it
gives the English mind a clue to the fundamental distinction that marks
off the Russian people from the peoples of the West Sophies
wordsYou spoke of the willthats what must be broken p
define most admirably the deepest aspiration of the Russian soul
To be lowly and suffering to be despised sick to be under the lash of
fate to be trampled under foot by others to be unworthy all this
secret desire of the Russian soul implies that the Russian has little
will that he finds it easier to resign himself than to make the
effort to be powerful triumphant worthy It is from the resignation
and softness of the Russian nature that all its characteristic virtues
spring Whereas religion with the English mind is largely an anxiety to
be moral to be right and righteous to be a chosen vessel of the
Lord religion with the Russian implies a genuine abasement and loss of
self a bowing before the will of Heaven and true brotherly love The
Western mind rises to greatness by concentrating the willpower in
action by assertion of all its inner force by shutting out forcibly
whatever might dominate or distract or weaken it But the Russian mind
through its lack of character willpower and hardness rises to
greatness in its acceptance of life and in its sympathy with all the
unfortunate the wretched the poor in spirit Of course in practical
life the Russian lacks many of the useful virtues the Western peoples
possess and has most of their vices but certainly his pity charity
and brotherliness towards men more unfortunate than himself largely
spring from his fatalistic acceptance of his own unworthiness and
weakness So in Sophies case the desire for selfsacrifice and her
impregnable conviction that to suffer and endure is right is truly
Russian in the sense of letting the individuality go with the stream
of fate not against it And hence the formidable spirit of the
youthful generation that sacrificed itself in the Nihilistic movement
the strenuous action of the youth once set in movement the spirit of
selfsacrifice impelled it calmly towards its goal despite all the
forces and threats of fate Sophie is indeed an early Nihilist born
before her time

We have said that the lack of will in the Russian nature is at the root
of Russian virtues and vices and in this connection it is curious to
remark that a races soul seems often to grow out of the races
aspiration towards what it is not in life Is not the French
intellect for example so cool clearheaded so delicately analytic of
its own motives that through the principle of counterpoise it strives
to lose itself and release itself in continual rhetoric and emotional
positions Is not the German mind so alive to the material facts of
life to the necessity of getting hold of concrete advantages in life
and of not letting them go that it deliberately slackens the bent bow
and plunges itself and relaxes itself in floods of abstractions and
idealisations and dreams of sentimentality Assuredly it is because the
Russian is so inwardly discontented with his own actions that he is such
a keen and incisive critic of everything false and exaggerated that
he despises all French rhetoric and German sentimentalism And in this
sense it is that the Russians lack of will comes in to deepen his soul
He surrenders himself thereby to the universe and as do the Asiatics
does not let the tiny shadow of his fate dark though it may be shut
out the universe so thoroughly from his consciousness as does the
aggressive struggling willpower of the Western man striving to let his
individuality have full play The Russians attitude may indeed be
compared to a bowl which catches and sustains what life brings it and
the Western mans to a bowl inverted to ward off what drops from the
impassive skies The mental attitude of the Russian peasant indeed
implies that in blood he is nearer akin to the Asiatics than Russian
ethnologists have wished to allow Certainly in the inner life of
thought intellectually morally and emotionally he is a halfway
house between the Western and Eastern races just as geographically he
spreads over the two continents By natural law his destiny calls him
towards the East Should he one day spread his rule further and further
among the Asiatics and hold the keys of an immense Asiatic empire well
future English philosophers may feel thereat a curious fatalistic
satisfaction

A DESPERATE CHARACTER




I


 We were a party of eight in the room and we were talking of
contemporary affairs and men

I dont understand these men observed A theyre such desperate
fellows Really desperate There has never been anything like
it before

Yes there has put in P a man getting on in years with grey hair
born some time in the twenties of this century there were desperate
characters in former days too only they were not like the desperate
fellows of today Of the poet Yazikov some one has said that he had
enthusiasm but not applied to anythingan enthusiasm without an
object So it was with those peopletheir desperateness was without an
object But there if youll allow me Ill tell you the story of my
nephew or rather cousin Misha Poltyev It may serve as an example of
the desperate characters of those days

He came into Gods world I remember in  at his fathers native
place and property in one of the sleepiest corners of a sleepy province
of the steppes Mishas father Andrei Nikolaevitch Poltyev I remember
well to this day He was a genuine oldworld landowner a Godfearing
sedate man fairlyfor those dayswell educated just a little
cracked to tell the truthand moreover he suffered from epilepsy
That too is an oldworld gentlemanly complaint Andrei
Nikolaevitchs fits were however slight and generally ended in sleep
and depression He was goodhearted and of an affable demeanour not
without a certain stateliness I always pictured to myself the tsar
Mihail Fedorovitch as like him The whole life of Andrei Nikolaevitch
was passed in the punctual fulfilment of every observance established
from old days in strict conformity with all the usages of the old
orthodox holy Russian mode of life He got up and went to bed ate his
meals and went to his bath rejoiced or was wroth both very rarely it
is true even smoked his pipe and played cards two great
innovations not after his own fancy not in a way of his own but
according to the custom and ordinance of his fatherswith due decorum
and formality He was tall well built and stout his voice was soft
and rather husky as is so often the case with virtuous people in
Russia he was scrupulously neat in his dress and linen and wore white
cravats and fullskirted snuffcoloured coats but his noble blood was
nevertheless evident no one could have taken him for a priests son or
a merchant At all times on all possible occasions and in all possible
contingencies Andrei Nikolaevitch knew without fail what ought to be
done what was to be said and precisely what expressions were to be
used he knew when he ought to take medicine and just what he ought to
take what omens were to be believed and what might be disregarded 
in fact he knew everything that ought to be done For as everything
had been provided for and laid down by ones elders one had only to be
sure not to imagine anything of ones self And above all without
Gods blessing not a step to be takenIt must be confessed that a
deadly dulness reigned supreme in his house in those lowpitched warm
dark rooms that so often resounded with the singing of liturgies and
allnight services and had the smell of incense and Lenten dishes
almost always hanging about them

Andrei Nikolaevitchno longer in his first youthmarried a young
lady of a neighbouring family without fortune a very nervous and
sickly person who had had a boardingschool education She played the
piano fairly spoke boardingschool French was easily moved to
enthusiasm and still more easily to melancholy and even tears
She was of unbalanced character in fact She regarded her life as
wasted could not care for her husband who of course did not
understand her but she respected him  she put up with him and
being perfectly honest and perfectly cold she never even dreamed of
another affection Besides she was always completely engrossed in
the care first of her own really delicate health secondly of the
health of her husband whose fits always inspired in her something
like superstitious horror and lastly of her only son Misha whom
she brought up herself with great zeal Andrei Nikolaevitch did not
oppose his wifes looking after Misha on the one condition of his
education never overstepping the lines laid down once and for all
within which everything must move in his house Thus for instance at
Christmastime and at New Year and St Vassilys eve it was
permissible for Misha to dress up and masquerade with the servant
boysand not only permissible but even a binding duty But at
any other time God forbid and so on and so on




II


I remember Misha at thirteen He was a very pretty boy with rosy little
cheeks and soft lips indeed he was soft and plumplooking all over
with prominent liquid eyes carefully brushed and combed caressing and
modesta regular little girl There was only one thing about him I did
not like he rarely laughed but when he did laugh his teethlarge
white teeth pointed like an animalsshowed disagreeably and the
laugh itself had an abrupt even savage almost animal sound and there
were unpleasant gleams in his eyes His mother was always praising him
for being so obedient and well behaved and not caring to make friends
with rude boys but always preferring feminine society A mothers
darling a milksop his father Andrei Nikolaevitch would call him
but hes always ready to go into the house of God And that I am
glad to see Only one old neighbour who had been a police captain
once said before me speaking of Misha Mark my words hell be a
rebel And this saying I remember surprised me very much at the time
The old police captain it is true used to see rebels on all sides

Just such an exemplary youth Misha continued to be till the eighteenth
year of his age up to the death of his parents both of whom he lost
almost on the same day As I was all the while living constantly at
Moscow I heard nothing of my young kinsman An acquaintance coming from
his province did it is true inform me that Misha had sold the paternal
estate for a trifling sum but this piece of news struck me as too
wildly improbable And behold all of a sudden one autumn morning there
flew into the courtyard of my house a carriage with a pair of splendid
trotting horses and a coachman of monstrous size on the box and in the
carriage wrapped in a cloak of military cut with a beaver collar two
yards deep and with a foraging cap cocked on one side  la diable
memporte sat  Misha On catching sight of me I was standing at
the drawingroom window gazing in astonishment at the flying equipage
he laughed his abrupt laugh and jauntily flinging back his cloak he
jumped out of the carriage and ran into the house

Misha Mihail Andreevitch I was beginning  Is it you

Call me Mishahe interrupted me Yes its I  I in my own
person I have come to Moscow  to see the world  and show
myself And here I am come to see you What do you say to my
horses Eh he laughed again

Though it was seven years since I had seen Misha last I recognised him
at once His face had remained just as youthful and as pretty as
everthere was no moustache even visible only his cheeks looked a
little swollen under his eyes and a smell of spirits came from his
lips Have you been long in Moscow I inquired

I supposed you were at home in the country looking after the
place 

Eh The country I threw up at once As soon as my parents diedmay
their souls rest in peaceMisha crossed himself scrupulously without
a shade of mockery at once without a moments delay  ein zwei
drei ha ha I let it go cheap damn it A rascally fellow turned up
But its no matter Anyway I am living as I fancy and amusing other
people But why are you staring at me like that Was I really to go
dragging on in the same old round do you suppose  My dear fellow
couldnt I have a glass of something

Misha spoke fearfully quick and hurriedly and at the same time as
though he were only just waked up from sleep

Misha upon my word I wailed have you no fear of God What do you
look like What an attire And you ask for a glass too And to sell such
a fine estate for next to nothing

God I fear always and do not forget he broke in But He is good
you knowGod is He will forgive And I am good too I have
never yet hurt any one in my life And drink is good too and as for
hurting it never hurt any one either And my getup is quite the most
correct thing Uncle would you like me to show you I can walk
straight Or to do a little dance

Oh spare me please A dance indeed Youd better sit down

As to that Ill sit down with pleasure But why do you say nothing
of my greys Just look at them theyre perfect lions Ive got them on
hire for the time but I shall buy them for certain  and the
coachman too Its ever so much cheaper to have ones own horses And
I had the money but I lost it yesterday at faro Its no matter Ill
make it up tomorrow Uncle  how about that little glass

I was still unable to get over my amazement Really Misha how old are
you You ought not to be thinking about horses or cards  but going
into the university or the service

Misha first laughed again then gave vent to a prolonged whistle

Well uncle I see youre in a melancholy humour today Ill come
back another time But I tell you what you come in the evening to
Sokolniki Ive a tent pitched there The gypsies sing  such
goingson And theres a streamer on the tent and on the streamer
written in large letters The Troupe of Poltyevs Gypsies The
streamer coils like a snake the letters are of gold attractive for
every one to read A free entertainmentwhoever likes to come  No
refusal Im making the dust fly in Moscow  to my glory  Eh will
you come Ah Ive one girl there  a serpent Black as your boot
spiteful as a dog and eyes  like living coals One can never tell
what shes going to dokiss or bite  Will you come uncle 
Well goodbye till we meet

And with a sudden embrace and a smacking kiss on my shoulder Misha
darted away into the courtyard and into the carriage waved his cap
over his head hallooedthe monstrous coachman leered at him over his
beard the greys dashed off and all vanished

The next day Ilike a sinnerset off to Sokolniki and did actually
see the tent with the streamer and the inscription The drapery of the
tent was raised from it came clamour creaking and shouting Crowds of
people were thronging round it On a carpet spread on the ground sat
gypsies men and women singing and beating drums and in the midst of
them in a red silk shirt and velvet breeches was Misha holding a
guitar dancing a jig Gentlemen honoured friends walk in please
the performance is just beginning Free to all he was shouting in a
high cracked voice Hey champagne pop a pop on the head pop up to
the ceiling Ha you rogue there Paul de Kock

Luckily he did not see me and I hastily made off

I wont enlarge on my astonishment at the spectacle of this
transformation But how was it actually possible for that quiet and
modest boy to change all at once into a drunken buffoon Could it all
have been latent in him from childhood and have come to the surface
directly the yoke of his parents control was removed But that he had
made the dust fly in Moscow as he expressed itof that certainly
there could be no doubt I have seen something of riotous living in my
day but in this there was a sort of violence a sort of frenzy of
selfdestruction a sort of desperation




III


For two months these diversions continued And once more I was
standing at my drawingroom window looking into the courtyard All
of a suddenwhat could it mean  there came slowly stepping in at the
gate a pilgrim  a squash hat pulled down on his forehead his hair
combed out straight to right and left below it a long gown a leather
belt  Could it be Misha He it was

I went to meet him on the steps Whats this masquerade for
I demanded

Its not a masquerade uncle Misha answered with a deep sigh since
all I had Ive squandered to the last farthingand a great repentance
too has come upon meso I have resolved to go to the Sergiev monastery
of the Holy Trinity to expiate my sins in prayer For what refuge was
left me  And so I have come to you to say goodbye uncle like a
prodigal son

I looked intently at Misha His face was just the same rosy and fresh
indeed it remained almost unchanged to the end and the eyes liquid
affectionate and languishingand the hands as small and white But
he smelt of spirits

Well I pronounced at last its a good thing to dosince theres
nothing else to be done But why is it you smell of spirits

A relic of the past answered Misha and he suddenly laughed but
immediately pulled himself up and making a straight low bowa monks
bowhe added Wont you help me on my way Im going see on foot to
the monastery

When

Today  at once

Why be in such a hurry

Uncle my motto always was Make haste make haste

But what is your motto now

Its the same now Only make haste towards good

And so Misha went off leaving me to ponder on the vicissitudes of
human destiny

But he soon reminded me of his existence Two months after his visit I
got a letter from him the first of those letters of which later on he
furnished me with so abundant a supply And note a peculiar fact I
have seldom seen a neater more legible handwriting than that
unbalanced fellows And the wording of his letters was exceedingly
correct just a little flowery Invariable entreaties for assistance
always attended with resolutions to reform vows and promises on his
honour All of it seemedand perhaps wassincere Mishas
signature to his letters was always accompanied by peculiar strokes
flourishes and stops and he made great use of marks of exclamation
In this first letter Misha informed me of a new turn in his fortune
Later on he used to refer to these turns as plunges  and frequent
were the plunges he took He was starting for the Caucasus on active
service for his tsar and his country in the capacity of a cadet And
though a certain benevolent aunt had entered into his impecunious
position and had sent him an inconsiderable sum still he begged me to
assist him in getting his equipment I did what he asked and for two
years I heard nothing more of him

I must own I had the gravest doubts as to his having gone to the
Caucasus But it turned out that he really had gone there had by
favour got into the T regiment as a cadet and had been serving in
it for those two years A perfect series of legends had sprung up there
about him An officer of his regiment related them to me




IV


I learned a great deal which I should never have expected of himI
was of course hardly surprised that as a military man as an officer
he was not a success that he was in fact worse than useless but what I
had not anticipated was that he was by no means conspicuous for much
bravery that in battle he had a downcast woebegone air seemed
halfdepressed halfbewildered Discipline of every sort worried him
and made him miserable he was daring to the point of insanity when only
his own personal safety was in question no bet was too mad for him to
accept but do harm to others kill fight he could not possibly
because his heart was too goodor possibly because his cottonwool
education so he expressed it had made him too soft Himself he was
quite ready to murder in any way at any moment But othersno
Theres no making him out his comrades said of him hes a flabby
creature a poor stickand yet such a desperate fellowa perfect
madman I chanced in later days to ask Misha what evil spirit
drove him forced him to drink to excess risk his life and so
on He always had one answerwretchedness

But why are you wretched

Why how can you ask If one comes anyway to ones self begins to
feel to think of the poverty of the injustice of Russia Well
its all over with me  ones so wretched at onceone wants to put a
bullet through ones head Ones forced to start drinking

Why ever do you drag Russia in

How can I help it Cant be helped Thats why Im afraid to think

It all comes and your wretchedness too from having nothing to do

But I dont know how to do anything uncle dear fellow Take ones
life and stake it on a cardthat I can do Come you tell me what I
ought to do what to risk my life for This instant  Ill 

But you must simply live Why risk your life

I cant You say I act thoughtlessly But what else can I do  If
one starts thinkinggood God all that comes into ones head Its only
Germans who can think 

What use was it talking to him He was a desperate man and thats all
one can say

Of the Caucasus legends I have spoken about I will tell you two or
three One day in a party of officers Misha began boasting of a sabre
he had got by exchangea genuine Persian blade The officers
expressed doubts as to its genuineness Misha began disputing Here
then he cried at last they say the man that knows most about sabres
is Abdulka the oneeyed Ill go to him and ask The officers
wondered What Abdulka Do you mean that lives in the mountains The
rebel never subdued Abdulkhan Yes thats him Why but hell
take you for a spy will put you in a hole full of bugs or else cut
your head off with your own sabre And besides how are you going to
get to him Theyll catch you directly Ill go to him though all
the same Bet you wont Taken And Misha promptly saddled his
horse and rode off to Abdulka He disappeared for three days All felt
certain that the crazy fellow had come by his end But behold he came
backdrunk and with a sabre not the one he had taken but another
They began questioning him It was all right said he Abdulkas a
nice fellow At first its true he ordered them to put irons on my
legs and was even on the point of having me impaled Only I explained
why I had come and showed him the sabre And youd better not keep
me said I dont expect a ransom for me Ive not a farthing to bless
myself withand Ive no relations Abdulka was surprised he looked at
me with his solitary eye Well said he you are a bold one you
Russian am I to believe you You may believe me said I I never
tell a lie And this was true Misha never lied Abdulka looked at me
again And do you know how to drink wine I do said I give me as
much as you will Ill drink it Abdulka was surprised again he called
on Allah And he told hisdaughter I supposesuch a pretty creature
only with an eye like a jackalsto bring a wineskin And I began to
get to work on it But your sabre said he isnt genuine here take
the real thing And now we are pledged friends But youve lost your
bet gentlemen pay up

The second legend of Misha is of this nature He was passionately fond
of cards but as he had no money and could never pay his debts at cards
though he was never a cardsharper no one at last would sit down to a
game with him So one day he began urgently begging one of his comrades
among the officers to play with him But if you lose you dont pay
The money certainly I cant pay but Ill put a shot through my left
hand see with this pistol here But whatever use will that be to
me No use but still it will be curious This conversation took
place after a drinking bout in the presence of witnesses Whether it was
that Mishas proposition struck the officer as really curiousanyway he
agreed Cards were brought the game began Misha was in luck he won a
hundred roubles And thereupon his opponent struck his forehead with
vexation What an ass I am he cried to be taken in like this As if
youd have shot your hand if you had losta likely story hold out
your purse Thats a lie retorted Misha Ive wonbut Ill shoot
my hand He snatched up his pistoland bang fired at his own hand
The bullet passed right through it  and in a week the wound had
completely healed

Another time Misha was riding with his comrades along a road at
night  and they saw close to the roadside a narrow ravine like a deep
cleft darkso dark you couldnt see the bottom Look said one of
the officers Misha may be a desperate fellow but he wouldnt leap
into that ravine Yes Id leap in No you wouldnt for I dare say
its seventy feet deep and you might break your neck His friend knew
his weak pointvanity There was a great deal of it in Misha But
Ill leap in anyway Would you like to bet on it Ten roubles Good
And the officer had hardly uttered the word when Misha and his horse
were offinto the ravineand crashing down over the stones All were
simply petrified A full minute passed and they heard Mishas voice
dimly as it were rising up out of the bowels of the earth All right
fell on the sand  but it was a long flight Ten roubles youve lost

Climb out shouted his comrades Climb out I dare say echoed
Misha A likely story I should like to see you climb out Youll have
to go for torches and ropes now And meanwhile to keep up my spirits
while I wait fling down a flask

And so Misha had to stay five hours at the bottom of the ravine and
when they dragged him out it turned out that his shoulder was
dislocated But that in no way troubled him The next day a bonesetter
one of the blacksmiths set his shoulder and he used it as though
nothing had been the matter

His health in general was marvellous incredible I have already
mentioned that up to the time of his death he kept his almost childishly
fresh complexion Illness was a thing unknown to him in spite of his
excesses the strength of his constitution never once showed signs of
giving way When any other man would infallibly have been seriously ill
or even have died he merely shook himself like a duck in the water
and was more blooming than ever Once also in the Caucasus  this
legend is really incredible but one may judge from it what Misha was
thought to be capable of Well once in the Caucasus in a state of
drunkenness he fell down with the lower half of his body in a stream of
water his head and arms were on the bank out of water It was
wintertime there was a hard frost and when he was found next morning
his legs and body were pulled out from under a thick layer of ice which
had formed over them in the nightand he didnt even catch cold
Another timethis was in Russia near Orel and also in a time of
severe frosthe was in a tavern outside the town in company with seven
young seminarists or theological students and these seminarists were
celebrating their final examination but had invited Misha as a
delightful person a man of inspiration as the phrase was then A
very great deal was drunk and when at last the festive party got ready
to depart Misha dead drunk was in an unconscious condition All the
seven seminarists together had but one threehorse sledge with a high
back where were they to stow the unresisting body Then one of the
young men inspired by classical reminiscences proposed tying Misha by
his feet to the back of the sledge as Hector was tied to the chariot of
Achilles The proposal met with approval  and jolting up and down
over the holes sliding sideways down the slopes with his legs torn and
flayed and his head rolling in the snow poor Misha travelled on his
back for the mile and a half from the tavern to the town and hadnt as
much as a cough afterwards hadnt turned a hair Such heroic health had
nature bestowed upon him




V


From the Caucasus he came again to Moscow in a Circassian dress a
dagger in his sash a highpeaked cap on his head This costume he
retained to the end though he was no longer in the army from which he
had been discharged for outstaying his leave He stayed with me
borrowed a little money  and forthwith began his plunges his
wanderings or as he expressed it his peregrinations from pillar to
post then came the sudden disappearances and returns and the showers
of beautifully written letters addressed to people of every possible
description from an archbishop down to stableboys and midwives Then
came calls upon persons known and unknown And this is worth noticing
when he made these calls he was never abject and cringing he never
worried people by begging but on the contrary behaved with propriety
and had positively a cheerful and pleasant air though the inveterate
smell of spirits accompanied him everywhere and his Oriental costume
gradually changed into rags Give and God will reward you though I
dont deserve it he would say with a bright smile and a candid blush
if you dont give youll be perfectly right and I shant blame you
for it I shall find food to eat God will provide And there are people
poorer than I and much more deserving of helpplenty plenty Misha
was particularly successful with women he knew how to appeal to their
sympathy But dont suppose that he was or fancied himself a
LovelaceOh no in that way he was very modest Whether it was that
he had inherited a cool temperament from his parents or whether indeed
this too is to be set down to his dislike for doing any one harmas
according to his notions relations with a woman meant inevitably doing
a woman harmI wont undertake to decide only in all his behaviour
with the fair sex he was extremely delicate Women felt this and were
the more ready to sympathise with him and help him until at last he
revolted them by his drunkenness and debauchery by the desperateness of
which I have spoken already I can think of no other word for it

But in other relations he had by that time lost every sort of delicacy
and was gradually sinking to the lowest depths of degradation He once
in the public assembly at T got as far as setting on the table a
jug with a notice Any one to whom it may seem agreeable to give the
highborn nobleman Poltyev authentic documents in proof of his
pedigree are herewith exposed a flip on the nose may satisfy this
inclination on putting a rouble into this jug And I am told there
were persons found willing to pay for the privilege of flipping a
noblemans nose It is true that one such person who put in only one
rouble and gave him two flips he first almost strangled and then
forced to apologise it is true too that part of the money gained in
this fashion he promptly distributed among other poor devils  but
still think what a disgrace

In the course of his peregrinations from pillar to post he made his
way too to his ancestral home which he had sold for next to nothing
to a speculator and moneylender well known in those days The
moneylender was at home and hearing of the presence in the
neighbourhood of the former owner now reduced to vagrancy he gave
orders not to admit him into the house and even in case of necessity
to drive him away Misha announced that he would not for his part
consent to enter the house polluted by the presence of so repulsive a
person that he would permit no one to drive him away but was going to
the churchyard to pay his devotions at the grave of his parents So in
fact he did

In the churchyard he was joined by an old houseserf who had once been
his nurse The moneylender had deprived this old man of his monthly
allowance and driven him off the estate since then his refuge had been
a corner in a peasants hut Misha had been too short a time in
possession of his estate to have left behind him a particularly
favourable memory still the old servant could not resist running to the
churchyard as soon as he heard of his young masters being there He
found Misha sitting on the ground between the tombstones asked for his
hand to kiss as in old times and even shed tears on seeing the rags
which clothed the limbs of his once pampered young charge

Misha gazed long and silently at the old man Timofay he said at
last Timofay started

What do you desire

Have you a spade

I can get one But what do you want with a spade Mihailo
Andreitch sir

I want to dig myself a grave Timofay and to lie here for time
everlasting between my father and mother Theres only this spot left me
in the world Get a spade

Yes sir said Timofay he went and got it And Misha began at once
digging in the ground while Timofay stood by his chin propped in his
hand repeating Its all thats left for you and me master

Misha dug and dug from time to time observing Lifes not worth
living is it Timofay

Its not indeed master

The hole was already of a good depth People saw what Misha was about
and ran to tell the new owner about it The moneylender was at first
very angry wanted to send for the police This is sacrilege said he
But afterwards probably reflecting that it was inconvenient anyway to
have to do with such a madman and that it might lead to a scandalhe
went in his own person to the churchyard and approaching Misha still
toiling made him a polite bow He went on with his digging as though he
had not noticed his successor Mihail Andreitch began the
moneylender allow me to ask what you are doing here

You can seeI am digging myself a grave

Why are you doing so

Because I dont want to live any longer

The moneylender fairly threw up his hands in amazement You dont
want to live

Misha glanced menacingly at the moneylender That surprises you
Arent you the cause of it all  You  You  Wasnt it you
Judas who robbed me taking advantage of my childishness Arent you
flaying the peasants skins off their backs Havent you taken from
this poor old man his crust of dry bread Wasnt it you  O God
everywhere nothing but injustice and oppression and evildoing
Everything must go to ruin then and me too I dont care for life I
dont care for life in Russia And the spade moved faster than ever in
Mishas hands

Heres a devil of a business thought the moneylender hes
positively burying himself alive Mihail Andreevitch he began
again listen Ive been behaving badly to you indeed they told me
falsely of you

Misha went on digging

But why be desperate

Misha still went on digging and kept throwing the earth at the
moneylenders feet as though to say Here you are landgrabber

Really you re wrong in this Wont you be pleased to come in to have
some lunch and rest a bit

Misha raised his head So thats it now And anything to drink

The moneylender was delighted Why of course  I should think so

You invite Timofay too

Well  yes him too

Misha pondered Only mind  you made me a beggar you know Dont
think you can get off with one bottle

Set your mind at rest  there shall be all you can want

Misha got up and flung down the spade Well Timosha said he to
his old nurse lets do honour to our host Come along

Yes sir answered the old man

And all three started off to the house together The moneylender knew
the man he had to deal with At the first start Misha it is true
exacted a promise from him to grant all sorts of immunities to the
peasants but an hour later this same Misha together with Timofay
both drunk were dancing a galop in the big apartments which still
seemed pervaded by the Godfearing shade of Andrei Nikolaevitch and an
hour later still Misha in a dead sleep he had a very weak head for
spirits laid in a cart with his high cap and dagger was being driven
off to the town more than twenty miles away and there was flung under
a hedge As for Timofay who could still keep on his legs and only
hiccuppedhim of course they kicked out of the house since they
couldnt get at the master they had to be content with the old servant




VI


Some time passed again and I heard nothing of Misha God knows what
he was doing But one day as I sat over the samovar at a
postingstation on the T highroad waiting for horses I suddenly
heard under the open window of the station room a hoarse voice uttering
in French the words Monsieur  monsieur  prenez piti dun pauvre
gentilhomme ruin  I lifted my head glanced The
mangylooking fur cap the broken ornaments on the ragged Circassian
dress the dagger in the cracked sheath the swollen but still rosy
face the dishevelled but still thick crop of hair Mercy on us
Misha He had come then to begging alms on the highroads I could not
help crying out He recognised me started turned away and was about
to move away from the window I stopped him  but what could I say to
him Give him a lecture  In silence I held out a fiverouble note
he also in silence took it in his still white and plump though
shaking and dirty hand and vanished round the corner of the house

It was a good while before they gave me horses and I had time to give
myself up to gloomy reflections on my unexpected meeting with Misha I
felt ashamed of having let him go so unsympathetically

At last I set off on my way and half a mile from the station I observed
ahead of me in the road a crowd of people moving along with a curious
as it seemed rhythmic step I overtook this crowdand what did I see

Some dozen or so beggars with sacks over their shoulders were walking
two by two singing and leaping about while in front of them danced
Misha stamping time with his feet and shouting Natchikitchikaldy
tchuk tchuk tchuk  Natchikitchikaldy tchuk tchuk tchuk
Directly my carriage caught them up and he saw me he began at once
shouting Hurrah Stand in position right about face guard of the
roadside

The beggars took up his shout and halted while he with his peculiar
laugh jumped on to the carriage step and again yelled Hurrah

Whats the meaning of this I asked with involuntary astonishment

This This is my company my armyall beggars Gods people friends
of my heart Every one of them thanks to you has had a glass and
now we are all rejoicing and making merry  Uncle Do you know its
only with beggars Gods people that one can live in the world  by
God it is

I made him no answer  but at that moment he struck me as such
a kind good creature his face expressed such childlike
simpleheartedness A light seemed suddenly as it were to dawn upon
me and I felt a pang in my heart Get into the carriage I said
to him He was taken aback

What Into the carriage

Yes get in get in I repeated I want to make you a suggestion Sit
down Come along with me

Well as you will He sat down Well and you my honoured friends
my dear comrades he added addressing the beggars farewell till we
meet again Misha took off his high cap and bowed low The beggars all
seemed overawed I told the coachman to whip up the horses and the
carriage rolled off

The suggestion I wanted to make Misha was this the idea suddenly
occurred to me to take him with me to my home in the country about
fiveandtwenty miles from that station to rescue him or at least to
make an effort to rescue him Listen Misha I said will you come
along and live with me  You shall have everything provided you you
shall have clothes and linen made you you shall be properly fitted out
and you shall have money to spend on tobacco and so on only on one
condition that you give up drink Do you agree

Misha was positively aghast with delight he opened his eyes wide
flushed crimson and suddenly falling on my shoulder began kissing me
and repeating in a broken voice Uncle  benefactor  God reward
you  He burst into tears at last and taking off his cap fell to
wiping his eyes his nose his lips with it

Mind I observed remember the condition not to touch strong drink

Damnation to it he cried with a wave of both arms and with this
impetuous movement I was more than ever conscious of the strong smell
of spirits with which he seemed always saturated Uncle if you
knew what my life has been If it hadnt been for sorrow a cruel
fate But now I swear I swear I will mend my ways I will show
you Uncle Ive never told a lieyou can ask whom you like Im
honest but Im an unlucky fellow uncle Ive known no kindness from
any one

Here he broke down finally into sobs I tried to soothe him and
succeeded so far that when we reached home Misha had long been lost in a
heavy sleep with his head on my knees




VII


He was at once assigned a room for himself and at once first thing
taken to the bath which was absolutely essential All his clothes and
his dagger and cap and torn boots were carefully put away in a loft he
was dressed in clean linen slippers and some clothes of mine which
as is always the way with poor relations at once seemed to adapt
themselves to his size and figure When he came to table washed clean
and fresh he seemed so touched and happy he beamed all over with such
joyful gratitude that I too felt moved and joyful His face was
completely transformed Boys of twelve have faces like that on Easter
Sundays after the communion when thickly pomaded in new jacket and
starched collars they come to exchange Easter greetings with their
parents Misha was continuallywith a sort of cautious
incredulityfeeling himself and repeating What does it mean  Am I
in heaven The next day he announced that he had not slept all night
he had been in such ecstasy

I had living in my house at that time an old aunt with her niece both
of them were extremely disturbed when they heard of Mishas presence
they could not comprehend how I could have asked him into my house
There were very ugly rumours about him But in the first place I knew
he was always very courteous with ladies and secondly I counted on
his promises of amendment And in fact for the first two days of his
stay under my roof Misha not merely justified my expectations but
surpassed them while the ladies of the household were simply enchanted
with him He played piquet with the old lady helped her to wind her
worsted showed her two new games of patience for the niece who had a
small voice he played accompaniments on the piano and read Russian and
French poetry He told both the ladies lively but discreet anecdotes in
fact he showed them every attention so that they repeatedly expressed
their surprise to me and the old lady even observed how unjust people
sometimes were The thingsthe things they had said of him  and
he such a quiet fellow and so polite  poor Misha It is true that at
table poor Misha licked his lips in a rather peculiar hurried way if
he simply glanced at the bottle But I had only to shake my finger at
him and he would turn his eyes upwards and lay his hand on his
heart  as if to say I have sworn I am regenerated now he
assured me Well God grant it be so was my thought But
this regeneration did not last long

The first two days he was very talkative and cheerful But even on the
third day he seemed somehow subdued though he remained as before with
the ladies and tried to entertain them A half mournful half dreamy
expression flitted now and then over his face and the face itself was
paler and looked thinner Are you unwell I asked him

Yes he answered my head aches a little On the fourth day he was
completely silent for the most part he sat in a corner hanging his
head disconsolately and his dejected appearance worked upon the
compassionate sympathies of the two ladies who now in their turn
tried to amuse him At table he ate nothing stared at his plate and
rolled up pellets of bread On the fifth day the feeling of compassion
in the ladies began to be replaced by other emotionsuneasiness and
even alarm Misha was so strange he held aloof from people and kept
moving along close to the walls as though trying to steal by unnoticed
and suddenly looking round as though some one had called him And what
had become of his rosy colour It seemed covered over by a layer of
earth Are you still unwell I asked him

No Im all right he answered abruptly

Are you dull

Why should I be dull But he turned away and would not look me
in the face

Or is it that wretchedness come over you again To this he made no
reply So passed another twentyfour hours

Next day my aunt ran into my room in a state of great excitement
declaring that she would leave the house with her niece if Misha was to
remain in it

Why so

Why we are dreadfully scared with him Hes not a man hes a
wolfnothing better than a wolf He keeps moving and moving about and
doesnt speakand looks so wild He almost gnashes his teeth at me
My Katia you know is so nervous She was so struck with him the
first day Im in terror for her and indeed for myself too  I
didnt know what to say to my aunt I couldnt anyway turn Misha out
after inviting him

He relieved me himself from my difficult position The same dayI was
still sitting in my own roomsuddenly I heard behind me a husky and
angry voice Nikolai Nikolaitch Nikolai Nikolaitch I looked round
Misha was standing in the doorway with a face that was fearful
blacklooking and distorted Nikolai Nikolaitch he repeated  not
uncle now

What do you want

Let me go  at once

Why

Let me go or I shall do mischief I shall set the house on fire or cut
some ones throat Misha suddenly began trembling Tell them to give
me back my clothes and let a cart take me to the highroad and let me
have some money however little

Are you displeased then at anything

I cant live like this he shrieked at the top of his voice I cant
live in your respectable thriceaccursed house It makes me sick and
ashamed to live so quietly  How you manage to endure it

That is I interrupted in my turn you meanyou cant live without
drink

Well yes yes he shrieked again only let me go to my
brethren my friends to the beggars  Away from your
respectable loathsome species

I was about to remind him of his sworn promises but Mishas frenzied
look his breaking voice the convulsive tremor in his limbsit was
all so awful that I made haste to get rid of him I said that his
clothes should be given him at once and a cart got ready and taking
a note for twentyfive roubles out of a drawer I laid it on the
table Misha had begun to advance in a menacing way towards mebut
on this suddenly he stopped his face worked flushed he struck
himself on the breast the tears rushed from his eyes and muttering
Uncle angel I know Im a ruined man thanks thanks he snatched
up the note and ran away

An hour later he was sitting in the cart dressed once more in his
Circassian costume again rosy and cheerful and when the horses
started he yelled tore off the peaked cap and waving it over his
head made bow after bow Just as he was going off he had given me a
long and warm embrace and whispered Benefactor benefactor 
theres no saving me He even ran to the ladies and kissed their hands
fell on his knees called upon God and begged their forgiveness Katia
I found afterwards in tears

The coachman with whom Misha had set off on coming home informed me
that he had driven him to the first tavern on the highroadand that
there his honour had stuck had begun treating every one
indiscriminatelyand had quickly sunk into unconsciousness
From that day I never came across Misha again but his ultimate fate I
learned in the following manner



VIII


Three years later I was again at home in the country all of a sudden a
servant came in and announced that Madame Poltyev was asking to see me
I knew no Madame Poltyev and the servant who made this announcement
for some unknown reason smiled sarcastically To my glance of inquiry
he responded that the lady asking for me was young poorly dressed and
had come in a peasants cart with one horse which she was driving
herself I told him to ask Madame Poltyev up to my room

I saw a woman of fiveandtwenty in the dress of the small tradesman
class with a large kerchief on her head Her face was simple roundish
not without charm she looked dejected and gloomy and was shy and
awkward in her movements

You are Madame Poltyev I inquired and I asked her to sit down

Yes she answered in a subdued voice and she did not sit down I am
the widow of your nephew Mihail Andreevitch Poltyev

Is Mihail Andreevitch dead Has he been dead long But sit down I
beg

She sank into a chair

Its two months

And had you been married to him long

I had been a year with him

Where have you come from now

From out Tula way Theres a village there
ZnamenskoeGlushkovoperhaps you may know it I am the daughter of the
deacon there Mihail Andreitch and I lived there He lived in my
fathers house We were a whole year together

The young womans lips twitched a little and she put her hand up to
them She seemed to be on the point of tears but she controlled
herself and cleared her throat

Mihail Andreitch she went on before his death enjoined upon me to
go to you You must be sure to go said he And he told me to thank
you for all your goodness and to give you  this  see this little
thing she took a small packet out of her pocket which he always had
about him And Mihail Andreitch said if you would be pleased to
accept it in memory of him if you would not disdain it Theres
nothing else said he I can give him  that is you

In the packet there was a little silver cup with the monogram of Mishas
mother This cup I had often seen in Mishas hands and once he had even
said to me speaking of some poor fellow that he really was destitute
since he had neither cup nor bowl while I see have this anyway

I thanked her took the cup and asked

Of what complaint had Misha died No doubt

Then I bit my tongue  but the young woman understood my unuttered
hint She took a swift glance at me then looked down again smiled
mournfully and said at once Oh no he had quite given that up ever
since he got to know me  But he had no health at all  It was
shattered quite As soon as he gave up drink he fell into ill health
directly He became so steady he always wanted to help father in his
land or in the garden  or any other work there might be  in spite
of his being of noble birth But how could he get the strength  At
writing too he tried to work as you know he could do that work
capitally but his hands shook and he couldnt hold the pen properly
 He was always finding fault with himself Im a whitehanded poor
creature he would say Ive never done any good to anybody never
helped never laboured He worried himself very much about that He
used to say that our people labourbut what use are we  Ah
Nikolai Nikolaitch he was a good manand he was fond of me  and
I Ah pardon me

Here the young woman wept outright I would have consoled her but I did
not know how

Have you a child left you I asked at last

She sighed No no child Is it likely And her tears flowed faster
than ever

And so that was how Mishas troubled wanderings had ended the old man
P wound up his narrative You will agree with me I am sure that Im
right in calling him a desperate character but you will most likely
agree too that he was not like the desperate characters of today
still a philosopher you must admit would find a family likeness
between him and them In him and in them theres the thirst for
selfdestruction the wretchedness the dissatisfaction And what it
all comes from I leave the philosopher to decide


BOUGIVALLE November 




A STRANGE STORY




I


Fifteen years agobegan Hofficial duties compelled me to spend a few
days in the principal town of the province of T I stopped at a very
fair hotel which had been established six months before my arrival by a
Jewish tailor who had grown rich I am told that it did not flourish
long which is often the case with us but I found it still in its full
splendour the new furniture emitted cracks like pistolshots at night
the bedlinen tablecloths and napkins smelt of soap and the painted
floors reeked of olive oil which however in the opinion of the
waiter an exceedingly elegant but not very clean individual tended to
prevent the spread of insects This waiter a former valet of Prince
Gs was conspicuous for his freeandeasy manners and his
selfassurance He invariably wore a secondhand frockcoat and slippers
trodden down at heel carried a tablenapkin under his arm and had a
multitude of pimples on his cheeks With a free sweeping movement of his
moist hands he gave utterance to brief but pregnant observations He
showed a patronising interest in me as a person capable of appreciating
his culture and knowledge of the world but he regarded his own lot in
life with a rather disillusioned eye No doubt about it he said to me
one day ours is a poor sort of position nowadays May be sent flying
any day His name was Ardalion

I had to make a few visits to official persons in the town Ardalion
procured me a coach and groom both alike shabby and loose in the
joints but the groom wore livery the carriage was adorned with an
heraldic crest After making all my official calls I drove to see a
country gentleman an old friend of my fathers who had been a long
time settled in the town I had not met him for twenty years he had
had time to get married to bring up a goodsized family to be left a
widower and to make his fortune His business was with government
monopolies that is to say he lent contractors for monopolies loans at
heavy interest There is always honour in risk they say though
indeed the risk was small

In the course of our conversation there came into the room with
hesitating steps but as lightly as though on tiptoe a young girl of
about seventeen delicatelooking and thin Here said my
acquaintance is my eldest daughter Sophia let me introduce you She
takes my poor wifes place looks after the house and takes care of her
brothers and sisters I bowed a second time to the girl who had come in
she meanwhile dropped into a chair without speaking and thought to
myself that she did not look much like housekeeping or looking after
children Her face was quite childish round with small pleasing but
immobile features the blue eyes under high also immobile and
irregular eyebrows had an intent almost astonished look as though
they had just observed something unexpected the full little mouth with
the lifted upper lip not only did not smile but seemed as though
altogether innocent of such a practice the rosy flush under the tender
skin stood in soft diffused patches on the cheeks and neither paled
nor deepened The fluffy fair hair hung in light clusters each side of
the little head Her bosom breathed softly and her arms were pressed
somehow awkwardly and severely against her narrow waist Her blue gown
fell without foldslike a childsto her little feet The general
impression this girl made upon me was not one of morbidity but of
something enigmatical I saw before me not simply a shy provincial
miss but a creature of a special typethat I could not make out This
type neither attracted nor repelled me I did not fully understand it
and only felt that I had never come across a nature more sincere Pity
 yes pity was the feeling that rose up within me at the sight of
this young serious keenly alert lifeGod knows why Not of this
earth was my thought though there was nothing exactly ideal in the
expression of the face and though Mademoiselle Sophie had obviously
come into the drawingroom in fulfilment of those duties of lady of the
house to which her father had referred

He began to talk of life in the town of T of the social amusements
and advantages it offered Were very quiet here he observed the
governors a melancholy fellow the marshal of the province is a
bachelor But therell be a big ball in the Hall of the Nobility the day
after tomorrow I advise you to go there are some pretty girls here
And youll see all our intelligentsi too

My acquaintance as a man of university education was fond of using
learned expressions He pronounced them with irony but also with
respect Besides we all know that moneylending together with
respectability developes a certain thoughtfulness in men

Allow me to ask will you be at the ball I said turning to my
friends daughter I wanted to hear the sound of her voice

Papa intends to go she answered and I with him

Her voice turned out to be soft and deliberate and she articulated
every syllable fully as though she were puzzled

In that case allow me to ask you for the first quadrille

She bent her head in token of assent and even then did not smile

I soon withdrew and I remember the expression in her eyes fixed
steadily upon me struck me as so strange that I involuntarily looked
over my shoulder to see whether there were not some one or some thing
she was looking at behind my back

I returned to the hotel and after dining on the nevervaried
soupejulienne cutlets and green peas and grouse cooked to a dry
black chip I sat down on the sofa and gave myself up to reflection The
subject of my meditations was Sophia this enigmatical daughter of my
old acquaintance but Ardalion who was clearing the table explained my
thoughtfulness in his own way he set it down to boredom

There is very little in the way of entertainment for visitors in our
town he began with his usual easy condescension while he went on at
the same time flapping the backs of the chairs with a dirty
dinnernapkina practice peculiar as youre doubtless aware to
servants of superior education Very little

He paused and the huge clock on the wall with a lilac rose on its
white face seemed in its monotonous sleepy tick to repeat his words
Very very it ticked No concerts nor theatres pursued Ardalion
he had travelled abroad with his master and had all but stayed in
Paris he knew much better than to mispronounce this last word as the
peasants donor dances for example nor evening receptions among the
nobility and gentrythere is nothing of the kind whatever He paused
a moment probably to allow me to observe the choiceness of his
diction They positively visit each other but seldom Every one sits
like a pigeon on its perch And so it comes to pass that visitors have
simply nowhere to go

Ardalion stole a sidelong glance at me

But there is one thing he went on speaking with a drawl in case
you should feel that way inclined

He glanced at me a second time and positively leered but I suppose did
not observe signs of the requisite inclination in me

The polished waiter moved towards the door pondered a moment came
back and after fidgeting about uneasily a little bent down to my ear
and with a playful smile said

Would you not like to behold the dead

I stared at him in perplexity

Yes he went on speaking in a whisper there is a man like that
here Hes a simple artisan and cant even read and write but he does
marvellous things If you for example go to him and desire to see any
one of your departed friends he will be sure to show him you

How does he do it

Thats his secret For though hes an uneducated manto speak bluntly
illiteratehes very great in godliness Greatly respected he is among
the merchant gentry

And does every one in the town know about this

Those who need to know but there of coursetheres danger from the
police to be guarded against Because say what you will such doings
are forbidden anyway and for the common people are a temptation the
common peoplethe mob we all know quickly come to blows

Has he shown you the dead I asked Ardalion

Ardalion nodded He has my father he brought before me as if living

I stared at Ardalion He laughed and played with his dinnernapkin and
condescendingly but unflinchingly looked at me

But this is very curious I cried at last Couldnt I make the
acquaintance of this artisan

You cant go straight to him but one can act through his mother Shes
a respectable old woman she sells pickled apples on the bridge If you
wish it I will ask her

Please do

Ardalion coughed behind his hand And a gratuity whatever you think
fit nothing much of course should also be handed to herthe old
lady And I on my side will make her understand that she has nothing to
fear from you as you are a visitor here a gentlemanand of course you
can understand that this is a secret and will not in any case get her
into any unpleasantness

Ardalion took the tray in one hand and with a graceful swing of the
tray and his own person turned towards the door

So I may reckon upon you I shouted after him

You may trust me I heard his selfsatisfied voice say Well talk to
the old woman and transmit you her answer exactly

                                   

I will not enlarge on the train of thought aroused in me by the
extraordinary fact Ardalion had related but I am prepared to admit that
I awaited the promised reply with impatience Late in the evening
Ardalion came to me and announced that to his annoyance he could not
find the old woman I handed him however by way of encouragement a
threerouble note The next morning he appeared again in my room with a
beaming countenance the old woman had consented to see me

Hi boy shouted Ardalion in the corridor Hi apprentice Come
here A boy of six came up grimed all over with soot like a kitten
with a shaved head perfectly bald in places in a torn striped smock
and huge goloshes on his bare feet You take the gentleman you know
where said Ardalion addressing the apprentice and pointing to me
And you sir when you arrive ask for Mastridia Karpovna

The boy uttered a hoarse grunt and we set off

                                   

We walked rather a long while about the unpaved streets of the town of
T at last in one of them almost the most deserted and desolate of
all my guide stopped before an old twostory wooden house and wiping
his nose all over his smocksleeve said Here go to the right I
passed through the porch into the outer passage stumbled towards my
right a low door creaked on rusty hinges and I saw before me a stout
old woman in a brown jacket lined with hareskin with a particoloured
kerchief on her head

Mastridia Karpovna I inquired

The same at your service the old woman replied in a piping voice
Please walk in Wont you take a chair

The room into which the old woman conducted me was so littered up with
every sort of rubbish rags pillows featherbeds sacks that one
could hardly turn round in it The sunlight barely struggled in through
two dusty little windows in one corner from behind a heap of boxes
piled on one another there came a feeble whimpering and wailing I
could not tell from what perhaps a sick baby or perhaps a puppy I sat
down on a chair and the old woman stood up directly facing me Her face
was yellow halftransparent like wax her lips were so fallen in that
they formed a single straight line in the midst of a multitude of
wrinkles a tuft of white hair stuck out from below the kerchief on her
head but the sunken grey eyes peered out alertly and cleverly from
under the bony overhanging brow and the sharp nose fairly stuck out
like a spindle fairly sniffed the air as if it would say Im a smart
one Well youre no fool was my thought At the same time she smelt
of spirits

I explained to her the object of my visit of which however as I
observed she must be aware She listened to me blinked her eyes
rapidly and only lifted her nose till it stuck out still more sharply
as though she were making ready to peck

To be sure to be sure she said at last Ardalion Matveitch did say
something certainly my son Vassinkas art you were wanting But we
cant be sure my dear sir

Oh why so I interposed As far as Im concerned you may feel
perfectly easy Im not an informer

Oh mercy on us the old woman caught me up hurriedly what do you
mean Could we dare to suppose such a thing of your honour And on what
ground could one inform against us Do you suppose its some sinful
contrivance of ours No sir my sons not the one to lend himself to
anything wicked  or give way to any sort of witchcraft God forbid
indeed holy Mother of Heaven The old woman crossed herself three
times Hes the foremost in prayer and fasting in the whole province
the foremost your honour he is And thats just it great grace has
been vouchsafed to him Yes indeed Its not the work of his hands
Its from on high my dear so it is

So you agree I asked when can I see your son

The old woman blinked again and shifted her rolled up handkerchief from
one sleeve to the other

Oh well sirwell sir I cant say

Allow me Mastridia Karpovna to hand you this I interrupted and I
gave her a tenrouble note

The old woman clutched it at once in her fat crooked fingers which
recalled the fleshy claws of an owl quickly slipped it into her sleeve
pondered a little and as though she had suddenly reached a decision
slapped her thighs with her open hand

Come here this evening a little after seven she said not in her
previous voice but in quite a different one more solemn and subdued
only not to this room but kindly go straight up to the floor above
and youll find a door to your left and you open that door and youll
go your honour into an empty room and in that room youll see a
chair Sit you down on that chair and wait and whatever you see dont
utter a word and dont do anything and please dont speak to my son
either for hes but young yet and he suffers from fits Hes very
easily scared hell tremble and shake like any chicken  a sad
thing it is

I looked at Mastridia You say hes young but since hes your son 

In the spirit sir in the spirit Manys the orphan I have under my
care she added wagging her head in the direction of the corner from
which came the plaintive whimper OO God Almighty holy Mother of
God And do you your honour before you come here think well which of
your deceased relations or friendsthe kingdom of Heaven to
themyoure desirous of seeing Go over your deceased friends and
whichever you select keep him in your mind keep him all the while till
my son comes

Why mustnt I tell your son whom 

Nay nay sir not one word He will find out what he needs in your
thoughts himself Youve only to keep your friend thoroughly in mind
and at your dinner drink a drop of winejust two or three glasses wine
never comes amiss The old woman laughed licked her lips passed her
hand over her mouth and sighed

So at halfpast seven I queried getting up from my chair

At halfpast seven your honour at halfpast seven Mastridia
Karpovna replied reassuringly

                                   

I took leave of the old woman and went back to the hotel I did not
doubt that they were going to make a fool of me but in what waythat
was what excited my curiosity With Ardalion I did not exchange more
than two or three words Did she see you he asked me knitting his
brow and on my affirmative reply he exclaimed The old womans as
good as any statesman I set to work in accordance with the
statesmans counsel to run over my deceased friends

After rather prolonged hesitation I fixed at last on an old man who
had long been dead a Frenchman once my tutor I selected him not
because he had any special attraction for me but his whole figure was
so original so unlike any figure of today that it would be utterly
impossible to imitate it He had an enormous head fluffy white hair
combed straight back thick black eyebrows a hawk nose and two large
warts of a pinkish hue in the middle of the forehead he used to wear a
green frockcoat with smooth brass buttons a striped waistcoat with a
standup collar a jabot and lace cuffs If he shows me my old
Dessaire I thought well I shall have to admit that hes a
sorcerer

At dinner I followed the old dames behest and drank a bottle of
Lafitte of the first quality so Ardalion averred though it had a
very strong flavour of burnt cork and a thick sediment at the bottom
of each glass

                                   

Exactly at halfpast seven I stood in front of the house where I had
conversed with the worthy Mastridia Karpovna All the shutters of the
windows were closed but the door was open I went into the house
mounted the shaky staircase to the first story and opening a door on
the left found myself as the old woman had said in a perfectly empty
rather large room a tallow candle set in the windowsill threw a dim
light over the room against the wall opposite the door stood a
wickerbottomed chair I snuffed the candle which had already burnt
down enough to form a long smouldering wick sat down on the chair and
began to wait

The first ten minutes passed rather quickly in the room itself there
was absolutely nothing which could distract my attention but I listened
intently to every rustle looked intently at the closed door My
heart was throbbing After the first ten minutes followed another ten
minutes then half an hour threequarters of an hour and not a stir of
any kind around I coughed several times to make my presence known I
began to feel bored and out of temper to be made a fool of in just that
way had not entered into my calculations I was on the point of getting
up from my seat taking the candle from the window and going
downstairs I looked at it the wick again wanted snuffing but as I
turned my eyes from the window to the door I could not help starting
with his back leaning against the door stood a man He had entered so
quickly and noiselessly that I had heard nothing He wore a simple blue
smock he was of middle height and rather thickset With his hands
behind his back and his head bent he was staring at me In the dim
light of the candle I could not distinctly make out his features I saw
nothing but a shaggy mane of matted hair falling on his forehead and
thick rather drawn lips and whitish eyes I was nearly speaking to him
but I recollected Mastridias injunction and bit my lips The man who
had come in continued to gaze at me and strange to say at the same
time I felt something like fear and as though at the word of command
promptly started thinking of my old tutor He still stood at the door
and breathed heavily as though he had been climbing a mountain or
lifting a weight while his eyes seemed to expand seemed to come closer
to meand I felt uncomfortable under their obstinate heavy menacing
stare at times those eyes glowed with a malignant inward fire a fire
such as I have seen in the eyes of a pointer dog when it points at a
hare and like a pointer dog he kept his eyes intently following
mine when I tried to double that is tried to turn my eyes away

                                   

So passed I do not know how longperhaps a minute perhaps a quarter of
an hour He still gazed at me I still experienced a certain discomfort
and alarm and still thought of the Frenchman Twice I tried to say to
myself What nonsense what a farce I tried to smile to shrug my
shoulders It was no use All initiative had all at once frozen up
within meI can find no other word for it I was overcome by a sort of
numbness Suddenly I noticed that he had left the door and was standing
a step or two nearer to me then he gave a slight bound both feet
together and stood closer still Then again  and again while the
menacing eyes were simply fastened on my whole face and the hands
remained behind and the broad chest heaved painfully These leaps
struck me as ridiculous but I felt dread too and what I could not
understand at all a drowsiness began suddenly to come upon me My
eyelids clung together  the shaggy figure with the whitish eyes in
the blue smock seemed double before me and suddenly vanished
altogether  I shook myself he was again standing between the door
and me but now much nearer Then he vanished againa sort of mist
seemed to fall upon him again he appeared  vanished again 
appeared again and always closer closer  his hard almost gasping
breathing floated across to me now Again the mist fell and all of a
sudden out of this mist the head of old Dessaire began to take distinct
shape beginning with the white brushedback hair Yes there were his
warts his black eyebrows his hook nose There too his green coat with
the brass buttons the striped waistcoat and jabot I shrieked I got
up The old man vanished and in his place I saw again the man in the
blue smock He moved staggering to the wall leaned his head and both
arms against it and heaving like an overloaded horse in a husky voice
said Tea Mastridia Karpovnahow she came there I cant sayflew to
him and saying Vassinka Vassinka began anxiously wiping away the
sweat which simply trickled from his face and hair I was on the point
of approaching her but she so insistently in such a heartrending
voice cried Your honour merciful sir have pity on us go away for
Christs sake that I obeyed while she turned again to her son
Breadwinner darling she murmured soothingly you shall have tea
directly directly And you too sir had better take a cup of tea at
home she shouted after me

                                   

When I got home I obeyed Mastridia and ordered some tea I felt
tiredeven weak Well Ardalion questioned me have you been did
you see something

He did certainly show me something  which Ill own I had not
anticipated I replied

Hes a man of marvellous power observed Ardalion carrying off the
samovar he is held in high esteem among the merchant gentry As I
went to bed and reflected on the incident that had occurred to me I
fancied at last that I had reached some explanation of it The man
doubtless possessed a considerable magnetic power acting by some means
which I did not understand of course upon my nerves he had evoked
within me so vividly so definitely the image of the old man of whom I
was thinking that at last I fancied that I saw him before my eyes
Such metastases such transferences of sensation are recognised by
science It was all very well but the force capable of producing such
effects still remained something marvellous and mysterious Say what
you will I thought Ive seen seen with my own eyes my dead tutor

                                   

The next day the ball in the Hall of Nobility took place Sophias
father called on me and reminded me of the engagement I had made with
his daughter At ten oclock I was standing by her side in the middle
of a ballroom lighted up by a number of copper lamps and was preparing
to execute the not very complicated steps of the French quadrille to
the resounding blare of the military band Crowds of people were there
the ladies were especially numerous and very pretty but the first
place among them would certainly have been given to my partner if it
had not been for the rather strange even rather wild look in her eyes
I noticed that she hardly ever blinked the unmistakable expression of
sincerity in her eyes did not make up for what was extraordinary in
them But she had a charming figure and moved gracefully though with
constraint When she waltzed and throwing herself a little back bent
her slender neck towards her right shoulder as though she wanted to
get away from her partner nothing more touchingly youthful and pure
could be imagined She was all in white with a turquoise cross on a
black ribbon

I asked her for a mazurka and tried to talk to her But her answers
were few and reluctant though she listened attentively with the same
expression of dreamy absorption which had struck me when I first met
her Not the slightest trace of desire to please at her age with her
appearance and the absence of a smile and those eyes continually
fixed directly upon the eyes of the person speaking to her though they
seemed at the same time to see something else to be absorbed with
something different What a strange creature Not knowing at last
how to thaw her I bethought me of telling her of my adventure of the
previous day

                                   

She heard me to the end with evident interest but was not as I had
expected surprised at what I told her and merely asked whether he was
not called Vassily I recollected that the old woman had called him
Vassinka Yes his name is Vassily I answered do you know him

There is a saintly man living here called Vassily she observed I
wondered whether it was he

Saintliness has nothing to do with this I remarked its simply
the action of magnetisma fact of interest for doctors and students
of science

I proceeded to expound my views on the peculiar force called magnetism
on the possibility of one mans will being brought under the influence
of anothers will and so on but my explanationswhich were it is
true somewhat confusedseemed to make no impression on her Sophie
listened dropping her clasped hands on her knees with a fan lying
motionless in them she did not play with it she did not move her
fingers at all and I felt that all my words rebounded from her as from
a statue of stone She heard them but clearly she had her own
convictions which nothing could shake or uproot

You can hardly admit miracles I cried

Of course I admit them she answered calmly And how can one help
admitting them Are not we told in the gospel that who has but a grain
of faith as big as a mustard seed he can remove mountains One need
only have faiththere will be miracles

It seems there is very little faith nowadays I observed anyway one
doesnt hear of miracles

But yet there are miracles you have seen one yourself No faith is
not dead nowadays and the beginning of faith 

The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom I interrupted

The beginning of faith pursued Sophie nothing daunted is
selfabasement  humiliation

Humiliation even I queried

Yes The pride of man haughtiness presumptionthat is what must be
utterly rooted up You spoke of the willthats what must be broken

I scanned the whole figure of the young girl who was uttering such
sentences My word the childs in earnest too was my thought I
glanced at our neighbours in the mazurka they too glanced at me and
I fancied that my astonishment amused them one of them even smiled at
me sympathetically as though he would say Well what do you think of
our queer young lady every one here knows what shes like

Have you tried to break your will I said turning to Sophie again

Every one is bound to do what he thinks right she answered in a
dogmatic tone Let me ask you I began after a brief silence do you
believe in the possibility of calling up the dead

Sophie softly shook her head

There are no dead

What

There are no dead souls they are undying and can always appear when
they like They are always about us

What Do you suppose for instance that an immortal soul may be at
this moment hovering about that garrison major with the red nose

Why not The sunlight falls on him and his nose and is not the
sunlight all light from God And what does external appearance
matter To the pure all things are pure Only to find a teacher to
find a leader

But excuse me excuse me I put in not I must own without malicious
intent You want a leader  but what is your priest for

Sophie looked coldly at me

You mean to laugh at me I suppose My priestly father tells me what I
ought to do but what I want is a leader who would show me himself in
action how to sacrifice ones self

She raised her eyes towards the ceiling With her childlike face and
that expression of immobile absorption of secret continual perplexity
she reminded me of the preraphaelite Madonnas

I have read somewhere she went on not turning to me and hardly
moving her lips of a grand person who directed that he should be
buried under a church porch so that all the people who came in should
tread him under foot and trample on him That is what one ought to
do in life

Boom boom trarara thundered the drums from the band I must own
such a conversation at a ball struck me as eccentric in the extreme the
ideas involuntarily kindled within me were of a nature anything but
religious I took advantage of my partners being invited to one of the
figures of the mazurka to avoid renewing our quasitheological
discussion

A quarter of an hour later I conducted Mademoiselle Sophie to her
father and two days after I left the town of T and the image of
the girl with the childlike face and the soul impenetrable as stone
slipped quickly out of my memory

Two years passed and it chanced that that image was recalled again to
me It was like this I was talking to a colleague who had just
returned from a tour in South Russia He had spent some time in the
town of T and told me various items of news about the
neighbourhood By the way he exclaimed you knew V G B very
well I fancy didnt you

Of course I know him

And his daughter Sophia do you know her

Ive seen her twice

Only fancy shes run away

Hows that

Well I dont know Three months ago she disappeared and nothings
been heard of her And the astonishing thing is no one can make out whom
shes run off with Fancy theyve not the slightest idea not the
smallest suspicion Shed refused all the offers made her and she was
most proper in her behaviour Ah these quiet religious girls are the
ones Its made an awful scandal all over the province Bs in
despair And whatever need had she to run away Her father carried
out her wishes in everything And whats so unaccountable all the
Lovelaces of the province are there all right not ones missing

And theyve not found her up till now

I tell you she might as well be at the bottom of the sea Its one rich
heiress less in the world thats the worst of it

This piece of news greatly astonished me It did not seem at all in
keeping with the recollection I had of Sophia B But there anything
may happen

                                   

In the autumn of the same year fate brought meagain on official
businessinto the S province which is as every one knows next to
the province of T It was cold and rainy weather the wornout
postinghorses could scarcely drag my light trap through the black slush
of the highroad One day I remember was particularly unlucky three
times we got stuck in the mud up to the axles of the wheels my driver
was continually giving up one rut and with moans and grunts trudging
across to the other and finding things no better with that In fact
towards evening I was so exhausted that on reaching the postingstation
I decided to spend the night at the inn I was given a room with a
brokendown wooden sofa a sloping floor and torn paper on the walls
there was a smell in it of kvas bastmats onions and even
turpentine and swarms of flies were on everything but at any rate I
could find shelter there from the weather and the rain had set in as
they say for the whole day I ordered a samovar to be brought and
sitting on the sofa settled down to those cheerless wayside reflections
so familiar to travellers in Russia

They were broken in upon by a heavy knocking that came from the common
room from which my room was separated by a deal partition This sound
was accompanied by an intermittent metallic jingle like the clank of
chains and a coarse male voice boomed out suddenly The blessing of
God on all within this house The blessing of God the blessing of God
Amen amen Scatter His enemies repeated the voice with a sort of
incongruous and savage drawl on the last syllable of each word A
noisy sigh was heard and a ponderous body sank on to the bench with the
same jingling sound Akulina servant of God come here the voice
began again Behold Clothed in rags and blessed  Hahaha Tfoo
Merciful God merciful God merciful God the voice droned like a
deacon in the choir Merciful God Creator of my body behold my
iniquity Ohoho Haha  Tfoo And all abundance be to this house
in the seventh hour

Whos that I asked the hospitable landlady who came in with
the samovar

That your honour she answered me in a hurried whisper is a
blessed holy man Hes not long come into our parts and here hes
graciously pleased to visit us In such weather The wets simply
trickling from him poor dear man in streams And you should see the
chains on himsuch a lot

The blessing of God the blessing of God the voice was heard again
Akulina Hey Akulina Akulinushkafriend where is our paradise Our
fair paradise of bliss In the wilderness is our paradise 
paradise And to this house from beginning of time great
happiness  o  o  o  The voice muttered something
inarticulate and again after a protracted yawn there came the hoarse
laugh This laugh broke out every time as it were involuntarily and
every time it was followed by vigorous spitting

Ah me Stepanitch isnt here Thats the worst of it the landlady
said as it were to herself as she stood with every sign of the
profoundest attention at the door He will say some word of salvation
and I foolish woman may not catch it

She went out quickly

                                   

In the partition there was a chink I applied my eye to it The crazy
pilgrim was sitting on a bench with his back to me I saw nothing but
his shaggy head as huge as a beercan and a broad bent back in a
patched and soaking shirt Before him on the earth floor knelt a
fraillooking woman in a jacket such as are worn by women of the
artisan classold and wet throughand with a dark kerchief pulled down
almost over her eyes She was trying to pull the holy mans boots off
her fingers slid off the greasy slippery leather The landlady was
standing near her with her arms folded across her bosom gazing
reverently at the man of God He was as before mumbling some
inarticulate words

At last the woman succeeded in tugging off the boots She almost fell
backwards but recovered herself and began unwinding the strips of rag
which were wrapped round the vagrants legs On the sole of his foot
there was a wound I turned away

A cup of tea wouldnt you bid me get you my dear I heard the hostess
saying in an obsequious voice

What a notion responded the holy man To indulge the sinful body
Ohoho Break all the bones in it  but she talks of tea Oh oh
worthy old woman Satan is strong within us Fight him with hunger
fight him with cold with the sluicegates of heaven the pouring
penetrating rain and he takes no harmhe is alive still Remember the
day of the Intercession of the Mother of God You will receive you will
receive in abundance

The landlady could not resist uttering a faint groan of admiration

Only listen to me Give all thou hast give thy head give thy shirt
If they ask not of thee yet give For God is allseeing Is it hard for
Him to destroy your roof He has given thee bread in His mercy and do
thou bake it in the oven He seeth all Se  e  eth Whose eye is
in the triangle Say whose

The landlady stealthily crossed herself under her neckerchief

The old enemy is adamant A  da  mant A  da  mant the
religious maniac repeated several times gnashing his teeth The old
serpent But God will arise Yes God will arise and scatter His
enemies I will call up all the dead I will go against His enemy
Hahaha Tfoo

Have you any oil said another voice hardly audible let me put some
on the wound I have got a clean rag

I peeped through the chink again the woman in the jacket was still
busied with the vagrants sore foot A Magdalen I thought

Ill get it directly my dear said the woman and coming into my
room she took a spoonful of oil from the lamp burning before the
holy picture

Whos that waiting on him I asked

We dont know sir who it is she too I suppose is seeking
salvation atoning for her sins But what a saintly man he is

Akulinushka my sweet child my dear daughter the crazy pilgrim was
repeating meanwhile and he suddenly burst into tears

The woman kneeling before him lifted her eyes to him Heavens where
had I seen those eyes

The landlady went up to her with the spoonful of oil She finished her
operation and getting up from the floor asked if there were a clean
loft and a little hay Vassily Nikititch likes to sleep on hay
she added

To be sure there is come this way answered the woman come this
way my dear she turned to the holy man and dry yourself and rest
The man coughed slowly got up from the benchhis chains clanked
againand turning round with his face to me looked for the holy
pictures and began crossing himself with a wide movement

I recognised him instantly it was the very artisan Vassily who had
once shown me my dead tutor

His features were little changed only their expression had become still
more unusual still more terrible The lower part of his swollen face
was overgrown with unkempt beard Tattered filthy wildlooking he
inspired in me more repugnance than horror He left off crossing
himself but still his eyes wandered senselessly about the corners of
the room about the floor as though he were waiting for something

Vassily Nikititch please come said the woman in the jacket with a
bow He suddenly threw up his head and turned round but stumbled and
tottered His companion flew to him at once and supported him under
the arm Judging by her voice and figure she seemed still young her
face it was almost impossible to see

Akulinushka friend the vagrant repeated once more in a shaking
voice and opening his mouth wide and smiting himself on the breast
with his fist he uttered a deep groan that seemed to come from the
bottom of his heart Both followed the landlady out of the room

I lay down on my hard sofa and mused a long while on what I had seen My
mesmeriser had become a regular religious maniac This was what he had
been brought to by the power which one could not but recognise in him

                                   

The next morning I was preparing to go on my way The rain was falling
as fast as the day before but I could not delay any longer My
servant as he gave me water to wash wore a special smile on his
face a smile of restrained irony I knew that smile well it
indicated that my servant had heard something discreditable or even
shocking about gentlefolks He was obviously burning with impatience
to communicate it to me

Well what is it I asked at last

Did your honour see the crazy pilgrim yesterday my man began at once

Yes what then

And did you see his companion too

Yes I saw her

Shes a young lady of noble family

What

Its the truth Im telling you some merchants arrived here this
morning from T they recognised her They did tell me her name but
Ive forgotten it

It was like a flash of enlightenment Is the pilgrim still
here I asked

I fancy hes not gone yet Hes been ever so long at the gate and
making such a wonderful wise todo that theres no getting by Hes
amusing himself with this tomfoolery he finds it pay no doubt

My man belonged to the same class of educated servants as Ardalion

And is the lady with him

Yes Shes in attendance on him

                                   

I went out on to the steps and got a view of the crazy pilgrim He was
sitting on a bench at the gate and bent down with both his open hands
pressed on it he was shaking his drooping head from right to left for
all the world like a wild beast in a cage The thick mane of curly hair
covered his eyes and shook from side to side and so did his pendulous
lips A strange almost unhuman muttering came from them His
companion had only just finished washing from a pitcher that was hanging
on a pole and without having yet replaced her kerchief on her head was
making her way back to the gate along a narrow plank laid across the
dark puddles of the filthy yard I glanced at her head which was now
entirely uncovered and positively threw up my hands with astonishment
before me stood Sophie B

She turned quickly round and fixed upon me her blue eyes immovable as
ever She was much thinner her skin looked coarser and had the
yellowishruddy tinge of sunburn her nose was sharper and her lips
were harder in their lines But she was not less goodlooking only
besides her old expression of dreamy amazement there was now a different
lookresolute almost bold intense and exalted There was not a trace
of childishness left in the face now

I went up to her Sophia Vladimirovna I cried can it be you In
such a dress  in such company

She started looked still more intently at me as though anxious to find
out who was speaking to her and without saying a word to me fairly
rushed to her companion

Akulinushka he faltered with a heavy sigh our sins sins 

Vassily Nikititch let us go at once Do you hear at once at once
she said pulling her kerchief on to her forehead with one hand while
with the other she supported the pilgrim under the elbow let us go
Vassily Nikititch there is danger here

Im coming my good girl Im coming the crazy pilgrim responded
obediently and bending his whole body forward he got up from the
seat Heres only this chain to fasten

I once more approached Sophia and told her my name I began beseeching
her to listen to me to say one word to me I pointed to the rain
which was coming down in bucketsful I begged her to have some care for
her health the health of her companion I mentioned her father But
she seemed possessed by a sort of wrathful a sort of vindictive
excitement without paying the slightest attention to me setting her
teeth and breathing hard she urged on the distracted vagrant in an
undertone in soft insistent words girt him up fastened on his
chains pulled on to his hair a childs cloth cap with a broken peak
stuck his staff in his hand slung a wallet on her own shoulder and
went with him out at the gate into the street To stop her actually
I had not the right and it would have been of no use and at my last
despairing call she did not even turn round Supporting the man of
God under his arm she stepped rapidly over the black mud of the
street and in a few moments across the dim dusk of the foggy morning
through the thick network of falling raindrops I saw the last glimpse
of the two figures the crazy pilgrim and Sophie They turned the
corner of a projecting hut and vanished for ever

                                   

I went back to my room I fell to pondering I could not understand it
I could not understand how such a girl well brought up young and
wealthy could throw up everything and every one her own home her
family her friends break with all her habits with all the comforts of
life and for what To follow a halfinsane vagrant to become his
servant I could not for an instant entertain the idea that the
explanation of such a step was to be found in any prompting however
depraved of the heart in love or passion One had but to glance at
the repulsive figure of the man of God to dismiss such a notion
entirely No Sophie had remained pure and to her all things were pure
I could not understand what Sophie had done but I did not blame her
as later on I have not blamed other girls who too have sacrificed
everything for what they thought the truth for what they held to be
their vocation I could not help regretting that Sophie had chosen just
that path but also I could not refuse her admiration respect even
In good earnest she had talked of selfsacrifice of abasement  in
her words were not opposed to acts She had sought a leader a guide
and had found him  and my God what a guide

Yes she had lain down to be trampled trodden under foot In the
process of time a rumour reached me that her family had succeeded at
last in finding out the lost sheep and bringing her home But at home
she did not live long and died like a Sister of Silence without
having spoken a word to any one

Peace to your heart poor enigmatic creature Vassily Nikititch is
probably on his crazy wanderings still the iron health of such
people is truly marvellous Perhaps though his epilepsy may have
done for him

PUNIN AND BABURIN

PIOTR PETROVITCHS STORY




I


 I am old and ill now and my thoughts brood oftenest upon death
every day coming nearer rarely I think of the past rarely I turn the
eyes of my soul behind me Only from time to timein winter as I sit
motionless before the glowing fire in summer as I pace with slow tread
along the shady avenueI recall past years events faces but it is
not on my mature years nor on my youth that my thoughts rest at such
times They either carry me back to my earliest childhood or to the
first years of boyhood Now for instance I see myself in the country
with my stern and wrathful grandmotherI was only twelveand two
figures rise up before my imagination

But I will begin my story consecutively and in proper order



I




The old footman Filippitch came in on tiptoe as usual with a cravat
tied up in a rosette with tightly compressed lips lest his breath
should be smelt with a grey tuft of hair standing up in the very
middle of his forehead He came in bowed and handed my grandmother on
an iron tray a large letter with an heraldic seal My grandmother put on
her spectacles read the letter through

Is he here she asked

What is my lady pleased  Filippitch began timidly

Imbecile The man who brought the letteris he here

He is here to be sure he is He is sitting in the countinghouse

My grandmother rattled her amber rosary beads

Tell him to come to me And you sir she turned to me sit
still

As it was I was sitting perfectly still in my corner on the stool
assigned to me

My grandmother kept me well in hand

                                   

Five minutes later there came into the room a man of fiveandthirty
blackhaired and swarthy with broad cheekbones a face marked with
smallpox a hook nose and thick eyebrows from under which the small
grey eyes looked out with mournful composure The colour of the eyes and
their expression were out of keeping with the Oriental cast of the rest
of the face The man was dressed in a decent longskirted coat He
stopped in the doorway and bowedonly with his head

So your names Baburin queried my grandmother and she added to
herself Il a lair dun armnien

Yes it is the man answered in a deep and even voice At the first
brusque sound of my grandmothers voice his eyebrows faintly quivered
Surely he had not expected her to address him as an equal

Are you a Russian orthodox

Yes

My grandmother took off her spectacles and scanned Baburin from head
to foot deliberately He did not drop his eyes he merely folded his
hands behind his back What particularly struck my fancy was his beard
it was very smoothly shaven but such blue cheeks and chin I had never
seen in my life

Yakov Petrovitch began my grandmother recommends you strongly
in his letter as sober and industrious why then did you leave
his service

He needs a different sort of person to manage his estate madam

A different  sort That I dont quite understand

My grandmother rattled her beads again Yakov Petrovitch writes to me
that there are two peculiarities about you What peculiarities

Baburin shrugged his shoulders slightly

I cant tell what he sees fit to call peculiarities Possibly that
I  dont allow corporal punishment

My grandmother was surprised Do you mean to say Yakov Petrovitch
wanted to flog you

Baburins swarthy face grew red to the roots of his hair

You have not understood me right madam I make it a rule not to employ
corporal punishment  with the peasants

My grandmother was more surprised than ever she positively threw up
her hands

Ah she pronounced at last and putting her head a little on one side
once more she scrutinised Baburin attentively So thats your rule is
it Well thats of no consequence whatever to me I dont want an
overseer but a countinghouse clerk a secretary What sort of a hand
do you write

I write well without mistakes in spelling

That too is of no consequence to me The great thing for me is for it
to be clear and without any of those new copybook letters with tails
that I dont like And whats your other peculiarity

Baburin moved uneasily coughed

Perhaps  the gentleman has referred to the fact that I am not
alone

You are married

Oh no  but 

My grandmother knit her brows

There is a person living with me  of the male sex  a comrade a
poor friend from whom I have never parted  for  let me see 
ten years now

A relation of yours

No not a relationa friend As to work there can be no possible
hindrance occasioned by him Baburin made haste to add as though
foreseeing objections He lives at my cost occupies the same room with
me he is more likely to be of use as he is well educatedspeaking
without flattery extremely so in factand his morals are exemplary

My grandmother heard Baburin out chewing her lips and half
closing her eyes

He lives at your expense

Yes

You keep him out of charity

As an act of justice  as its the duty of one poor man to help
another poor man

Indeed Its the first time Ive heard that I had supposed till now
that that was rather the duty of rich people

For the rich if I may venture to say so it is an entertainment  but
for such as we 

Well well thats enough thats enough my grandmother cut him
short and after a moments thought she queried speaking through her
nose which was always a bad sign And what age is he your protg

About my own age

Really I imagined that you were bringing him up

Not so he is my comradeand besides 

Thats enough my grandmother cut him short a second time Youre a
philanthropist it seems Yakov Petrovitch is right for a man in your
position its something very peculiar But now lets get to business
Ill explain to you what your duties will be And as regards wages
Que faites vous ici added my grandmother suddenly turning her dry
yellow face to meAllez tudier votre devoir de mythologie

I jumped up went up to kiss my grandmothers hand and went outnot
to study mythology but simply into the garden

                                   

The garden on my grandmothers estate was very old and large and was
bounded on one side by a flowing pond in which there were not only
plenty of carp and eels but even loach were caught those renowned
loach that have nowadays disappeared almost everywhere At the head
of this pond was a thick clump of willows further and higher on both
sides of a rising slope were dense bushes of hazel elder
honeysuckle and sloethorn with an undergrowth of heather and clover
flowers Here and there between the bushes were tiny clearings
covered with emeraldgreen silky fine grass in the midst of which
squat funguses peeped out with their comical variegated pink lilac
and strawcoloured caps and golden balls of hendazzle blazed in
light patches Here in springtime the nightingales sang the
blackbirds whistled the cuckoos called here in the heat of summer it
was always cooland I loved to make my way into the wilderness and
thicket where I had favourite secret spots knownso at least I
imaginedonly to me

On coming out of my grandmothers room I made straight for one of these
spots which I had named Switzerland But what was my astonishment
when before I had reached Switzerland I perceived through the
delicate network of halfdry twigs and green branches that some one
besides me had found it out A long long figure in a long loose coat
of yellow frieze and a tall cap was standing in the very spot I loved
best of all I stole up a little nearer and made out the face which
was utterly unknown to me also very long and soft with small reddish
eyes and a very funny nose drawn out as long as a pod of peas it
positively overhung the full lips and these lips quivering and
forming a round O were giving vent to a shrill little whistle while
the long fingers of the bony hands placed facing one another on the
upper part of the chest were rapidly moving with a rotatory action
From time to time the motion of the hands subsided the lips ceased
whistling and quivering the head was bent forward as though listening
I came still nearer examined him still more closely The stranger
held in each hand a small flat cup such as people use to tease
canaries and make them sing A twig snapped under my feet the stranger
started turned his dim little eyes towards the copse and was
staggering away  but he stumbled against a tree uttered an
exclamation and stood still

I came out into the open space The stranger smiled

Good morning said I

Good morning little master

I did not like his calling me little master Such familiarity

What are you doing here I asked sternly

Why look here he responded never leaving off smiling Im calling
the little birds to sing He showed me his little cups The
chaffinches answer splendidly You at your tender years take delight
no doubt in the feathered songsters notes Listen I beg I will begin
chirping and theyll answer me directlyits so delightful

He began rubbing his little cups A chaffinch actually did chirp in
response from a mountain ash near The stranger laughed without a sound
and winked at me

The laugh and the winkevery gesture of the stranger his weak
lisping voice his bent knees and thin hands his very cap and long
frieze coateverything about him suggested goodnature something
innocent and droll

Have you been here long I asked

I came today

Why arent you the person of whom 

Mr Baburin spoke to the lady here The same the same

Your friends names Baburin and whats yours

Im Punin Punins my name Punin Hes Baburin and Im Punin He set
the little cups humming again Listen listen to the chaffinch How
it carols

This queer creature took my fancy awfully all at once Like almost all
boys I was either timid or consequential with strangers but I felt
with this man as if I had known him for ages

Come along with me I said to him I know a place better than
this theres a seat there we can sit down and we can see the dam
from there

By all means let us go my new friend responded in his singing voice
I let him pass before me As he walked he rolled from side to side
tripped over his own feet and his head fell back

I noticed on the back of his coat under the collar there hung a small
tassel Whats that youve got hanging there I asked

Where he questioned and he put his hand up to the collar to feel
Ah the tassel Let it be I suppose it was sewn there for ornament
Its not in the way

I led him to the seat and sat down he settled himself beside me Its
lovely here he commented and he drew a deep deep sigh Oh how
lovely You have a most splendid garden Oh ooh

I looked at him from one side What a queer cap youve got I couldnt
help exclaiming Show it me here

By all means little master by all means He took off the cap I was
holding out my hand but I raised my eyes andsimply burst out
laughing Punin was completely bald not a single hair was to be seen on
the high conical skull covered with smooth white skin He passed his
open hand over it and he too laughed When he laughed he seemed as it
were to gulp he opened his mouth wide closed his eyesand vertical
wrinkles flitted across his forehead in three rows like waves Eh
said he at last isnt it quite like an egg

Yes yes exactly like an egg I agreed with enthusiasm And have you
been like that long

Yes a long while but what hair I used to haveA golden fleece like
that for which the Argonauts sailed over the watery deeps

Though I was only twelve yet thanks to my mythological studies I knew
who the Argonauts were I was the more surprised at hearing the name on
the lips of a man dressed almost in rags

You must have learned mythology then I queried as I twisted his cap
over and over in my hands It turned out to be wadded with a
mangylooking fur trimming and a broken cardboard peak

I have studied that subject my dear little master Ive had time
enough for everything in my life But now restore to me my covering it
is a protection to the nakedness of my head

He put on the cap and with a downward slope of his whitish eyebrows
asked me who I was and who were my parents

Im the grandson of the lady who owns this place I answered I live
alone with her Papa and mamma are dead

Punin crossed himself May the kingdom of heaven be theirs So then
youre an orphan and the heir too The noble blood in you is visible
at once it fairly sparkles in your eyes and plays like this  sh 
sh  sh  He represented with his fingers the play of the blood
Well and do you know your noble honour whether my friend has come to
terms with your grandmamma whether he has obtained the situation he was
promised

I dont know

Punin cleared his throat Ah if one could be settled here if only for
a while Or else one may wander and wander far and find not a place to
rest ones head the disquieting alarms of life are unceasing the soul
is confounded

Tell me I interrupted are you of the clerical profession

Punin turned to me and half closed his eyelids And what may be the
cause of that question gentle youth

Why you talk sowell as they read in church

Because I use the old scriptural forms of expression But that ought
not to surprise you Admitting that in ordinary conversation such forms
of expression are not always in place but when one soars on the wings
of inspiration at once the language too grows more exalted Surely your
teacherthe professor of Russian literatureyou do have lessons in
that I supposesurely he teaches you that doesnt he

No he doesnt I responded When we stay in the country I have no
teacher In Moscow I have a great many teachers

And will you be staying long in the country

Two months not longer grandmother says that Im spoilt in the
country though I have a governess even here

A French governess

Yes

Punin scratched behind his ear A mamselle thats to say

Yes shes called Mademoiselle Friquet I suddenly felt it
disgraceful for me a boy of twelve to have not a tutor but a
governess like a little girl But I dont mind her I added
contemptuously What do I care

Punin shook his head Ah you gentlefolk you gentlefolk youre too
fond of foreigners You have turned away from what is Russiantowards
all thats strange Youve turned your hearts to those that come from
foreign parts

Hullo Are you talking in verse I asked

Well and why not I can do that always as much as you please for it
comes natural to me

But at that very instant there sounded in the garden behind us a loud
and shrill whistle My new acquaintance hurriedly got up from the bench

Goodbye little sir thats my friend calling me looking for me
What has he to tell me Goodbyeexcuse me

He plunged into the bushes and vanished while I sat on some time longer
on the seat I felt perplexity and another feeling rather an agreeable
one  I had never met nor spoken to any one like this before
Gradually I fell to dreaming but recollected my mythology and sauntered
towards the house

                                   

At home I learned that my grandmother had arranged to take Baburin he
had been assigned a small room in the servants quarters overlooking
the stableyard He had at once settled in there with his friend

When I had drunk my tea next morning without asking leave of
Mademoiselle Friquet I set off to the servants quarters I wanted to
have another chat with the queer fellow I had seen the day before
Without knocking at the doorthe very idea of doing so would never have
occurred to usI walked straight into the room I found in it not the
man I was looking for not Punin but his protectorthe philanthropist
Baburin He was standing before the window without his outer garment
his legs wide apart He was busily engaged in rubbing his head and neck
with a long towel

What do you want he observed keeping his hands still raised and
knitting his brows

Punins not at home then I queried in the most freeandeasy manner
without taking off my cap

Mr Punin Nikander Vavilitch at this moment is not at home truly
Baburin responded deliberately but allow me to make an observation
young man its not the proper thing to come into another persons room
like this without asking leave

I  young man  how dared he  I grew crimson with fury

You cannot be aware who I am I rejoined in a manner no longer
freeandeasy but haughty I am the grandson of the mistress here

Thats all the same to me retorted Baburin setting to work with his
towel again Though you are the seignorial grandson you have no right
to come into other peoples rooms

Other peoples What do you mean Imat home hereeverywhere

No excuse me hereIm at home since this room has been assigned to
me by agreement in exchange for my work

Dont teach me if you please I interrupted I know better than
you what 

You must be taught he interrupted in his turn for youre at an age
when you  I know my duties but I know my rights too very well and
if you continue to speak to me in that way I shall have to ask you to
go out of the room

There is no knowing how our dispute would have ended if Punin had not at
that instant entered shuffling and shambling from side to side He most
likely guessed from the expression of our faces that some unpleasantness
had passed between us and at once turned to me with the warmest
expressions of delight

Ah little master little master he cried waving his hands wildly
and going off into his noiseless laugh the little dear come to pay me
a visit here hes come the little dear Whats the meaning of it I
thought can he be speaking in this familiar way to me There come
along come with me into the garden Ive found something there Why
stay in this stuffiness here lets go

I followed Punin but in the doorway I thought it as well to turn round
and fling a glance of defiance at Baburin as though to say Im not
afraid of you

He responded in the same way and positively snorted into the
towelprobably to make me thoroughly aware how utterly he despised me

What an insolent fellow your friend is I said to Punin directly the
door had closed behind me

Almost with horror Punin turned his plump face to me

To whom did you apply that expression he asked me with round eyes

Why to him of course Whats his name that  Baburin

Paramon Semyonevitch

Why yes that  blackfaced fellow

Eh  eh  eh  Punin protested with caressing reproachfulness
How can you talk like that little master Paramon Semyonevitch is the
most estimable man of the strictest principles an extraordinary
person To be sure he wont allow any disrespect to him becausehe
knows his own value That man possesses a vast amount of knowledgeand
its not a place like this he ought to be filling You must my dear
behave very courteously to him do you know hes  here Punin bent
down quite to my eara republican

I stared at Punin This I had not at all expected From Keidanovs
manual and other historical works I had gathered the fact that at some
period or other in ancient times there had existed republicans Greeks
and Romans For some unknown reason I had always pictured them all in
helmets with round shields on their arms and big bare legs but that
in real life in the actual present above all in Russia in the
province of X one could come across republicansthat upset all my
notions and utterly confounded them

Yes my dear yes Paramon Semyonitch is a republican repeated Punin
there so youll know for the future how one should speak of a man like
that But now lets go into the garden Fancy what Ive found there A
cuckoos egg in a redstarts nest a lovely thing

I went into the garden with Punin but mentally I kept repeating
republican re  pub  lican

So I decided at lastthats why he has such a blue chin

                                   

My attitude to these two personsPunin and Baburintook definite shape
from that very day Baburin aroused in me a feeling of hostility with
which there was however in a short time mingled something akin to
respect And wasnt I afraid of him I never got over being afraid of
him even when the sharp severity of his manner with me at first had
quite disappeared It is needless to say that of Punin I had no fear I
did not even respect him I looked upon himnot to put too fine a point
on itas a buffoon but I loved him with my whole soul To spend hours
at a time in his company to be alone with him to listen to his
stories became a genuine delight to me My grandmother was anything but
pleased at this intimit with a person of the lower classesdu
commun but whenever I could break away I flew at once to my queer
amusing beloved friend Our meetings became more frequent after the
departure of Mademoiselle Friquet whom my grandmother sent back to
Moscow in disgrace because in conversation with a military staff
captain visiting in the neighbourhood she had had the insolence to
complain of the dulness which reigned in our household And Punin for
his part was not bored by long conversations with a boy of twelve he
seemed to seek them of himself How often have I listened to his
stories sitting with him in the fragrant shade on the dry smooth
grass under the canopy of the silver poplars or among the reeds above
the pond on the coarse damp sand of the hollow bank from which the
knotted roots protruded queerly interlaced like great black veins
like snakes like creatures emerging from some subterranean region
Punin told me the whole story of his life in minute detail describing
all his happy adventures and all his misfortunes with which I always
felt the sincerest sympathy His father had been a deacona splendid
manbut under the influence of drink stern to the last extreme

Punin himself had received his education in a seminary but unable to
stand the severe thrashings and feeling no inclination for the priestly
calling he had become a layman and in consequence had experienced all
sorts of hardships and finally had become a vagrant And had I not
met with my benefactor Paramon Semyonitch Punin commonly added he
never spoke of Baburin except in this way I should have sunk into the
miry abysses of poverty and vice Punin was fond of highsounding
expressions and had a great propensity if not for lying for romancing
and exaggeration he admired everything fell into ecstasies over
everything And I in imitation of him began to exaggerate and be
ecstatic too What a crazy fellow youve grown God have mercy on
you my old nurse used to say to me Punins narratives used to
interest me extremely but even better than his stories I loved the
readings we used to have together

It is impossible to describe the feeling I experienced when snatching
a favourable moment suddenly like a hermit in a tale or a good fairy
he appeared before me with a ponderous volume under his arm and
stealthily beckoning with his long crooked finger and winking
mysteriously he pointed with his head his eyebrows his shoulders
his whole person toward the deepest recesses of the garden whither no
one could penetrate after us and where it was impossible to find us
out And when we had succeeded in getting away unnoticed when we had
satisfactorily reached one of our secret nooks and were sitting side
by side and at last the book was slowly opened emitting a pungent
odour inexpressibly sweet to me then of mildew and agewith what a
thrill with what a wave of dumb expectancy I gazed at the face at
the lips of Punin those lips from which in a moment a stream of such
delicious eloquence was to flow At last the first sounds of the
reading were heard Everything around me vanished  no not vanished
but grew far away passed into clouds of mist leaving behind only an
impression of something friendly and protecting Those trees those
green leaves those high grasses screen us hide us from all the rest
of the world no one knows where we are what we are aboutwhile with
us is poetry we are saturated in it intoxicated with it something
solemn grand mysterious is happening to us Punin by preference
kept to poetry musical sonorous poetry he was ready to lay down his
life for poetry He did not read he declaimed the verse majestically
in a torrent of rhythm in a rolling outpour through his nose like a
man intoxicated lifted out of himself like the Pythian priestess And
another habit he had first he would lisp the verses through softly in
a whisper as it were mumbling them to himself This he used to call
the rough sketch of the reading then he would thunder out the same
verse in its fair copy and would all at once leap up throw up his
hand with a halfsupplicating halfimperious gesture In this way
we went through not only Lomonosov Sumarokov and Kantemir the older
the poems the more they were to Punins taste but even Heraskovs
Rossiad And to tell the truth it was this same Rossiad which
aroused my enthusiasm most There is in it among others a mighty
Tatar woman a gigantic heroine I have forgotten even her name now
but in those days my hands and feet turned cold as soon as it was
mentioned Yes Punin would say nodding his head with great
significance Heraskov he doesnt let one off easily At times one
comes upon a line simply heartbreaking One can only stick to it
and do ones best One tries to master it but he breaks away again
and trumpets trumpets with the crash of cymbals His names been well
bestowed on himthe very word Herrraskov Lomonosov Punin found
fault with for too simple and free a style while to Derzhavin he
maintained an attitude almost of hostility saying that he was more of
a courtier than a poet In our house it was not merely that no
attention was given to literature to poetry but poetry especially
Russian poetry was looked upon as something quite undignified and
vulgar my grandmother did not even call it poetry but doggrel
verses every author of such doggrel was in her opinion either a
confirmed toper or a perfect idiot Brought up among such ideas it was
inevitable that I should either turn from Punin with disgusthe was
untidy and shabby into the bargain which was an offence to my
seignorial habitsor that attracted and captivated by him I should
follow his example and be infected by his passion for poetry And
so it turned out I too began reading poetry or as my grandmother
expressed it poring over doggrel trash I even tried my hand at
versifying and composed a poem descriptive of a barrelorgan in
which occurred the following two lines


  Lo the barrel turns around
  And the cogs within resound


Punin commended in this effort a certain imitative melody but
disapproved of the subject itself as low and unworthy of lyrical
treatment

Alas all those efforts and emotions and transports our solitary
readings our life together our poetry all came to an end at once
Trouble broke upon us suddenly like a clap of thunder

                                   

My grandmother in everything liked cleanliness and order quite in the
spirit of the active generals of those days cleanliness and order were
to be maintained too in our garden And so from time to time they
drove into it poor peasants who had no families no land no beasts
of their own and those among the house serfs who were out of favour or
superannuated and set them to clearing the paths weeding the borders
breaking up and sifting the earth in the beds and so on Well one day
in the very heat of these operations my grandmother went into the
garden and took me with her On all sides among the trees and about
the lawns we caught glimpses of white red and blue smocks on all
sides we heard the scraping and clanging of spades the dull thud of
clods of earth on the slanting sieves As she passed by the labourers
my grandmother with her eagle eye noticed at once that one of them was
working with less energy than the rest and that he took off his cap
too with no show of eagerness This was a youth still quite young
with a wasted face and sunken lustreless eyes His cotton smock all
torn and patched scarcely held together over his narrow shoulders

Whos that my grandmother inquired of Filippitch who was walking on
tiptoe behind her

Of whom  you are pleased  Filippitch stammered

Oh fool I mean the one that looked so sullenly at me There standing
yonder not working

Oh him Yes  th  th  thats Yermil son of Pavel Afanasiitch
now deceased

Pavel Afanasiitch had been ten years before head butler in my
grandmothers house and stood particularly high in her favour But
suddenly falling into disgrace he was as suddenly degraded to being
herdsman and did not long keep even that position He sank lower still
and struggled on for a while on a monthly pittance of flour in a little
hut far away At last he had died of paralysis leaving his family in
the most utter destitution

Aha commented my grandmother its clear the apples not fallen far
from the tree Well we shall have to make arrangements about this
fellow too Ive no need of people like that with scowling faces

My grandmother went back to the houseand made arrangements Three
hours later Yermil completely equipped was brought under the window
of her room The unfortunate boy was being transported to a settlement
the other side of the fence a few steps from him was a little cart
loaded with his poor belongings Such were the times then Yermil stood
without his cap with downcast head barefoot with his boots tied up
with a string behind his back his face turned towards the seignorial
mansion expressed not despair nor grief nor even bewilderment a
stupid smile was frozen on his colourless lips his eyes dry and
halfclosed looked stubbornly on the ground My grandmother was
apprised of his presence She got up from the sofa went with a faint
rustle of her silken skirts to the window of the study and holding
her goldenrimmed double eyeglass on the bridge of her nose looked at
the new exile In her room there happened to be at the moment four other
persons the butler Baburin the page who waited on my grandmother in
the daytime and I

My grandmother nodded her head up and down

Madam a hoarse almost stifled voice was heard suddenly I looked
round Baburins face was red  dark red under his overhanging brows
could be seen little sharp points of light There was no doubt about
it it was he it was Baburin who had uttered the word Madam

My grandmother too looked round and turned her eyeglass from Yermil
to Baburin

Who is that  speaking she articulated slowly  through her nose
Baburin moved slightly forward

Madam he began it is I I venture  I imagine  I make bold
to submit to your honour that you are making a mistake in acting as 
as you are pleased to act at this moment

That is my grandmother said in the same voice not removing
her eyeglass

I take the liberty  Baburin went on distinctly uttering every word
though with obvious effortI am referring to the case of this lad who
is being sent away to a settlement  for no fault of his Such
arrangements I venture to submit lead to dissatisfaction and to
otherwhich God forbidconsequences and are nothing else than a
transgression of the powers allowed to seignorial proprietors

And where have you studied pray my grandmother asked after a short
silence and she dropped her eyeglass

Baburin was disconcerted What are you pleased to wish he muttered

I ask you where have you studied You use such learned words

I  my education  Baburin was beginning

My grandmother shrugged her shoulders contemptuously It seems she
interrupted that my arrangements are not to your liking That is of
absolutely no consequence to meamong my subjects I am sovereign and
answerable to no one for them only I am not accustomed to having people
criticising me in my presence and meddling in what is not their
business I have no need of learned philanthropists of nondescript
position I want servants to do my will without question So I always
lived till you came and so I shall live after youve gone You do not
suit me you are discharged Nikolai Antonov my grandmother turned to
the steward pay this man off and let him be gone before dinnertime
today Dyou hear Dont put me into a passion And the other too 
the fool that lives with himto be sent off too Whats Yermilka
waiting for she added looking out of window I have seen him What
more does he want My grandmother shook her handkerchief in the
direction of the window as though to drive away an importunate fly
Then she sat down in a low chair and turning towards us gave the order
grimly Everybody present to leave the room

We all withdrewall except the day page to whom my grandmothers
words did not apply because he was nobody

My grandmothers decree was carried out to the letter Before dinner
both Baburin and my friend Punin were driving away from the place I
will not undertake to describe my grief my genuine truly childish
despair It was so strong that it stifled even the feeling of
awestricken admiration inspired by the bold action of the republican
Baburin After the conversation with my grandmother he went at once to
his room and began packing up He did not vouchsafe me one word one
look though I was the whole time hanging about him or rather in
reality about Punin The latter was utterly distraught and he too said
nothing but he was continually glancing at me and tears stood in his
eyes  always the same tears they neither fell nor dried up He did
not venture to criticise his benefactorParamon Semyonitch could not
make a mistakebut great was his distress and dejection Punin and I
made an effort to read something out of the Rossiad for the last time
we even locked ourselves up in the lumberroomit was useless to dream
of going into the gardenbut at the very first line we both broke down
and I fairly bellowed like a calf in spite of my twelve years and my
claims to be grownup

When he had taken his seat in the carriage Baburin at last turned to me
and with a slight softening of the accustomed sternness of his face
observed Its a lesson for you young gentleman remember this
incident and when you grow up try to put an end to such acts of
injustice Your heart is good your nature is not yet corrupted
Mind be careful things cant go on like this Through my tears which
streamed copiously over my nose my lips and my chin I faltered out
that I would  I would remember that I promised  I would do  I
would be sure  quite sure 

But at this point Punin whom I had before this embraced twenty times
my cheeks were burning from the contact with his unshaven beard and I
was odoriferous of the smell that always clung to himat this point a
sudden frenzy came over Punin He jumped up on the seat of the cart
flung both hands up in the air and began in a voice of thunder where
he got it from to declaim the wellknown paraphrase of the Psalm of
David by Derzhavina poet for this occasionnot a courtier

  God the Allpowerful doth arise
  And judgeth in the congregation of the mighty 
  How long how long saith the Lord
  Will ye have mercy on the wicked
  Ye have to keep the laws

Sit down Baburin said to him

Punin sat down but continued

  To save the guiltless and needy
  To give shelter to the afflicted
  To defend the weak from the oppressors

Punin at the word oppressors pointed to the seignorial abode and then
poked the driver in the back

  To deliver the poor out of bondage
  They know not neither will they understand 

Nikolai Antonov running out of the seignorial abode shouted at the top
of his voice to the coachman Get away with you owl go along dont
stay lingering here and the cart rolled away Only in the distance
could still be heard

  Arise O Lord God of righteousness 
  Come forth to judge the unjust
  And be Thou the only Ruler of the nations

What a clown remarked Nikolai Antonov

He didnt get enough of the rod in his young days observed the
deacon appearing on the steps He had come to inquire what hour it
would please the mistress to fix for the night service

The same day learning that Yermil was still in the village and would
not till early next morning be despatched to the town for the execution
of certain legal formalities which were intended to check the
arbitrary proceedings of the landowners but served only as a source of
additional revenue to the functionaries in superintendence of them I
sought him out and for lack of money of my own handed him a bundle
in which I had tied up two pockethandkerchiefs a shabby pair of
slippers a comb an old nightgown and a perfectly new silk cravat
Yermil whom I had to wake uphe was lying on a heap of straw in the
back yard near the cartYermil took my present rather indifferently
with some hesitation in fact did not thank me promptly poked his head
into the straw and fell asleep again I went home somewhat
disappointed I had imagined that he would be astonished and overjoyed
at my visit would see in it a pledge of my magnanimous intentions for
the futureand instead of that 

You may say what you likethese people have no feeling was my
reflection on my homeward way

My grandmother who had for some reason left me in peace the whole of
that memorable day looked at me suspiciously when I came after supper
to say goodnight to her

Your eyes are red she observed to me in French and theres a smell
of the peasants hut about you I am not going to enter into an
examination of what youve been feeling and doingI should not like to
be obliged to punish youbut I hope you will get over all your
foolishness and begin to conduct yourself once more in a manner
befitting a wellbred boy However we are soon going back to Moscow
and I shall get you a tutoras I see you need a mans hand to manage
you You can go

We did as a fact go back soon after to Moscow




II




Seven years had passed by We were living as before at Moscowbut I was
by now a student in my second yearand the authority of my grandmother
who had aged very perceptibly in the last years no longer weighed upon
me Of all my fellowstudents the one with whom I was on the friendliest
terms was a lighthearted and goodnatured youth called Tarhov Our
habits and our tastes were similar Tarhov was a great lover of poetry
and himself wrote verses while in me the seeds sown by Punin had not
been without fruit As is often the case with young people who are very
close friends we had no secrets from one another But behold for
several days together I noticed a certain excitement and agitation in
Tarhov He disappeared for hours at a time and I did not know where
he had got toa thing which had never happened before I was on the
point of demanding in the name of friendship a full explanation He
anticipated me

One day I was sitting in his room Petya he said suddenly
blushing gaily and looking me straight in the face I must introduce
you to my muse

Your muse how queerly you talk Like a classicist Romanticism was at
that time in  at its full height As if I had not known it ever
so longyour muse Have you written a new poem or what

You dont understand what I mean rejoined Tarhov still laughing and
blushing I will introduce you to a living muse

Aha so thats it But how is sheyours

Why because  But hush I believe its she coming here

There was the light click of hurrying heels the door opened and in the
doorway appeared a girl of eighteen in a chintz cotton gown with a
black cloth cape on her shoulders and a black straw hat on her fair
rather curly hair On seeing me she was frightened and disconcerted and
was beating a retreat  but Tarhov at once rushed to meet her

Please please Musa Pavlovna come in This is my great friend a
splendid fellowand the soul of discretion Youve no need to be afraid
of him Petya he turned to me let me introduce my MusaMusa
Pavlovna Vinogradov a great friend of mine

I bowed

How is that  Musa I was beginning Tarhov laughed Ah you
didnt know there was such a name in the calendar I didnt know it
either my boy till I met this dear young lady Musa such a charming
name And suits her so well

I bowed again to my comrades great friend She left the door took two
steps forward and stood still She was very attractive but I could not
agree with Tarhovs opinion and inwardly said to myself Well shes a
strange sort of muse

The features of her curved rosy face were small and delicate there was
an air of fresh buoyant youth about all her slender miniature figure
but of the muse of the personification of the muse Iand not only
Iall the young people of that time had a very different conception
First of all the muse had infallibly to be darkhaired and pale An
expression of scornful pride a bitter smile a glance of inspiration
and that somethingmysterious demonic fatefulthat was essential
to our conception of the muse the muse of Byron who at that time held
sovereign sway over mens fancies There was nothing of that kind to be
discerned in the face of the girl who came in Had I been a little older
and more experienced I should probably have paid more attention to her
eyes which were small and deepset with full lids but dark as agate
alert and bright a thing rare in fairhaired people Poetical
tendencies I should not have detected in their rapid as it were
elusive glance but hints of a passionate soul passionate to
selfforgetfulness But I was very young then

I held out my hand to Musa Pavlovnashe did not give me hersshe did
not notice my movement she sat down on the chair Tarhov placed for her
but did not take off her hat and cape

She was obviously ill at ease my presence embarrassed her She
drew deep breaths at irregular intervals as though she were
gasping for air

Ive only come to you for one minute Vladimir Nikolaitch she
beganher voice was very soft and deep from her crimson almost
childish lips it seemed rather strangebut our madame would not let
me out for more than half an hour You werent well the day before
yesterday  and so I thought 

She stammered and hung her head Under the shade of her thick low brows
her dark eyes dartedto and froelusively There are dark swift
flashing beetles that flit so in the heat of summer among the blades of
dry grass

How good you are Musa Musotchka cried Tarhov But you must stay
you must stay a little Well have the samovar in directly

Oh no Vladimir Nikolaevitch its impossible I must go away
this minute

You must rest a little anyway Youre out of breath Youre tired

Im not tired Its  not that  only  give me another book
Ive finished this one She took out of her pocket a tattered grey
volume of a Moscow edition

Of course of course Well did you like it Roslavlev added
Tarhov addressing me

Yes Only I think Yury Miloslavsky is much better Our madame is very
strict about books She says they hinder our working For to her
thinking 

But I say Yury Miloslavskys not equal to Pushkins Gipsies Eh
Musa Pavlovna Tarhov broke in with a smile

No indeed The Gipsies  she murmured slowly Oh yes another
thing Vladimir Nikolaitch dont come tomorrow  you know where

Why not

Its impossible

But why

The girl shrugged her shoulders and all at once as though she had
received a sudden shove got up from her chair

Why Musa Musotchka Tarhov expostulated plaintively Stay a
little

No no I cant She went quickly to the door took hold of the
handle

Well at least take the book

Another time

Tarhov rushed towards the girl but at that instant she darted out of
the room He almost knocked his nose against the door What a girl
Shes a regular little viper he declared with some vexation and then
sank into thought

I stayed at Tarhovs I wanted to find out what was the meaning of it
all Tarhov was not disposed to be reserved He told me that the girl
was a milliner that he had seen her for the first time three weeks
before in a fashionable shop where he had gone on a commission for his
sister who lived in the provinces to buy a hat that he had fallen in
love with her at first sight and that next day he had succeeded in
speaking to her in the street that she had herself it seemed taken
rather a fancy to him

Only please dont you suppose he added with warmthdont you
imagine any harm of her So far at any rate theres been nothing of
that sort between us

Harm I caught him up Ive no doubt of that and Ive no doubt
either that you sincerely deplore the fact my dear fellow Have
patienceeverything will come right

I hope so Tarhov muttered through his teeth though with a laugh
But really my boy that girl  I tell youits a new type you
know You hadnt time to get a good look at her Shes a shy thingoo
such a shy thing and what a will of her own But that very shyness is
what I like in her Its a sign of independence Im simply over head
and ears my boy

Tarhov fell to talking of his charmer and even read me the beginning
of a poem entitled My Muse His emotional outpourings were not quite
to my taste I felt secretly jealous of him I soon left him

                                   

A few days after I happened to be passing through one of the arcades of
the Gostinny Dvor It was Saturday there were crowds of people
shopping on all sides in the midst of the pushing and crushing the
shopmen kept shouting to people to buy Having bought what I wanted I
was thinking of nothing but getting away from their teasing importunity
as soon as possiblewhen all at once I halted involuntarily in a fruit
shop I caught sight of my comrades charmerMusa Musa Pavlovna She
was standing profile to me and seemed to be waiting for something
After a moments hesitation I made up my mind to go up to her and speak
But I had hardly passed through the doorway of the shop and taken off my
cap when she tottered back dismayed turned quickly to an old man in a
frieze cloak for whom the shopman was weighing out a pound of raisins
and clutched at his arm as though fleeing to put herself under his
protection The latter in his turn wheeled round facing herand
imagine my amazement I recognised him as Punin

Yes it was he there were his inflamed eyes his full lips his soft
overhanging nose He had in fact changed little during the last seven
years his face was a little flabbier perhaps

Nikander Vavilitch I cried Dont you know me Punin started
opened his mouth stared at me

I havent the honour he was beginningand all at once he piped out
shrilly The little master of Trotsky my grandmothers property was
called Trotsky Can it be the little master of Trotsky

The pound of raisins tumbled out of his hands

It really is I answered and picking up Punins purchase from the
ground I kissed him

He was breathless with delight and excitement he almost cried removed
his capwhich enabled me to satisfy myself that the last traces of hair
had vanished from his eggtook a handkerchief out of it blew his
nose poked the cap into his bosom with the raisins put it on again
again dropped the raisins I dont know how Musa was behaving all
this time I tried not to look at her I dont imagine Punins agitation
proceeded from any extreme attachment to my person it was simply that
his nature could not stand the slightest unexpected shock The nervous
excitability of these poor devils

Come and see us my dear boy he faltered at last you wont be too
proud to visit our humble nest Youre a student I see 

On the contrary I shall be delighted really

Are you independent now

Perfectly independent

Thats capital How pleased Paramon Semyonitch will be Today hell be
home earlier than usual and madame lets her too off for Saturdays
But stop excuse me I am quite forgetting myself Of course you dont
know our niece

I hastened to slip in that I had not yet had the pleasure

Of course of course How could you know her Musotchka  Take note
my dear sir this girls name is Musaand its not a nickname but her
real name  Isnt that a predestination Musotchka I want to
introduce you to Mr  Mr 

B I prompted

B he repeated Musotchka listen You see before you the most
excellent most delightful of young men Fate threw us together when he
was still in years of boyhood I beg you to look on him as a friend

I swung off a low bow Musa red as a poppy flashed a look on me from
under her eyelids and dropped them immediately

Ah thought I you re one of those who in difficult moments dont
turn pale but red that must be made a note of

You must be indulgent shes not a fine lady observed Punin and he
went out of the shop into the street Musa and I followed him

                                   

The house in which Punin lodged was a considerable distance from the
Gostinny Dvor being in fact in Sadovoy Street On the way my former
preceptor in poetry had time to communicate a good many details of his
mode of existence Since the time of our parting both he and Baburin
had been tossed about holy Russia pretty thoroughly and had not
longonly a year and a half beforefound a permanent home in Moscow
Baburin had succeeded in becoming headclerk in the office of a rich
merchant and manufacturer Not a lucrative berth Punin observed with
a sigha lot of work and not much profit  but whats one to do
One must be thankful to get that I too am trying to earn something by
copying and lessons only my efforts have so far not been crowned with
success My writing you perhaps recollect is oldfashioned not in
accordance with the tastes of the day and as regards lessonswhat has
been a great obstacle is the absence of befitting attire moreover I
greatly fear that in the matter of instructionin the subject of
Russian literatureI am also not in harmony with the tastes of the day
and so it comes about that I am turned away Punin laughed his sleepy
subdued laugh He had retained his old somewhat highflown manner of
speech and his old weakness for falling into rhyme All run after
novelties nothing but innovations I dare say you too do not honour
the old divinities and fall down before new idols

And you Nikander Vavilitch do you really still esteem Heraskov

Punin stood still and waved both hands at once In the highest degree
sir in the high  est de  gree I do

And you dont read Pushkin You dont like Pushkin

Punin again flung his hands up higher than his head

Pushkin Pushkin is the snake lying hid in the grass who is endowed
with the note of the nightingale

While Punin and I talked like this cautiously picking our way over the
unevenly laid brick pavement of socalled whitestoned Moscowin
which there is not one stone and which is not white at allMusa walked
silently beside us on the side further from me In speaking of her I
called her your niece Punin was silent for a little scratched his
head and informed me in an undertone that he had called her so 
merely as a manner of speaking that she was really no relation that
she was an orphan picked up and cared for by Baburin in the town of
Voronezh but that he Punin might well call her daughter as he loved
her no less than a real daughter I had no doubt that though Punin
intentionally dropped his voice Musa could hear all he said very well
and she was at once angry and shy and embarrassed and the lights and
shades chased each other over her face and everything in it was
slightly quivering the eyelids and brows and lips and narrow nostrils
All this was very charming and amusing and queer

                                   

But at last we reached the modest nest And modest it certainly was
the nest It consisted of a small onestoried house that seemed almost
sunk into the ground with a slanting wooden roof and four dingy
windows in the front The furniture of the rooms was of the poorest and
not over tidy indeed Between the windows and on the walls hung about a
dozen tiny wooden cages containing larks canaries and siskins My
subjects Punin pronounced triumphantly pointing his finger at them
We had hardly time to get in and look about us Punin had hardly sent
Musa for the samovar when Baburin himself came in He seemed to me to
have aged much more than Punin though his step was as firm as ever and
the expression of his face altogether was unchanged but he had grown
thin and bent his cheeks were sunken and his thick black shock of hair
was sprinkled with grey He did not recognise me and showed no
particular pleasure when Punin mentioned my name he did not even smile
with his eyes he barely nodded he askedvery carelessly and
drilywhether my granny were livingand that was all Im not
overdelighted at a visit from a nobleman he seemed to say I dont
feel flattered by it The republican was a republican still

Musa came back a decrepit little old woman followed her bringing in a
tarnished samovar Punin began fussing about and pressing me to take
things Baburin sat down to the table leaned his head on his hands and
looked with weary eyes about him At tea however he began to talk He
was dissatisfied with his position A screwnot a man so he spoke of
his employer people in a subordinate position are so much dirt to him
of no consequence whatever and yet its not so long since he was under
the yoke himself Nothing but cruelty and covetousness Its a bondage
worse than the governments And all the trade here rests on swindling
and flourishes on nothing else

Hearing such dispiriting utterances Punin sighed expressively
assented shook his head up and down and from side to side Musa
maintained a stubborn silence She was obviously fretted by the
doubt what I was whether I was a discreet person or a gossip And if I
were discreet whether it was not with some afterthought in my mind Her
dark swift restless eyes fairly flashed to and fro under their
halfdrooping lids Only once she glanced at me but so inquisitively
so searchingly almost viciously  I positively started Baburin
scarcely talked to her at all but whenever he did address her there
was a note of austere hardly fatherly tenderness in his voice

Punin on the contrary was continually joking with Musa she responded
unwillingly however He called her little snowmaiden little
snowflake

Why do you give Musa Pavlovna such names I asked

Punin laughed Because shes such a chilly little thing

Sensible put in Baburin as befits a young girl

We may call her the mistress of the house cried Punin Hey Paramon
Semyonitch Baburin frowned Musa turned away  I did not understand
the hint at the time

So passed two hours  in no very lively fashion though Punin did his
best to entertain the honourable company For instance he squatted
down in front of the cage of one of the canaries opened the door and
commanded On the cupola Begin the concert The canary fluttered out
at once perched on the cupola that is to say on Punins bald pate
and turning from side to side and shaking its little wings carolled
with all its might During the whole time the concert lasted Punin kept
perfectly still only conducting with his finger and half closing his
eyes I could not help roaring with laughter  but neither Baburin nor
Musa laughed

Just as I was leaving Baburin surprised me by an unexpected question
He wished to ask me as a man studying at the university what sort of
person Zeno was and what were my ideas about him

What Zeno I asked somewhat puzzled

Zeno the sage of antiquity Surely he cannot be unknown to you

I vaguely recalled the name of Zeno as the founder of the school of
Stoics but I knew absolutely nothing more about him

Yes he was a philosopher I pronounced at last

Zeno Baburin resumed in deliberate tones was that wise man who
declared that suffering was not an evil since fortitude overcomes all
things and that the good in this world is one justice and virtue
itself is nothing else than justice

Punin turned a reverent ear

A man living here who has picked up a lot of old books told me that
saying continued Baburin it pleased me much But I see you are not
interested in such subjects

Baburin was right In such subjects I certainly was not interested
Since I had entered the university I had become as much of a republican
as Baburin himself Of Mirabeau of Robespierre I would have talked
with zest Robespierre indeed  why I had hanging over my
writingtable the lithographed portraits of FouquierTinville and
Chalier But Zeno Why drag in Zeno

As he said goodbye to me Punin insisted very warmly on my visiting
them next day Sunday Baburin did not invite me at all and even
remarked between his teeth that talking to plain people of nondescript
position could not give me any great pleasure and would most likely be
disagreeable to my granny At that word I interrupted him however
and gave him to understand that my grandmother had no longer any
authority over me

Why youve not come into possession of the property have you
queried Baburin

No I havent I answered

Well then it follows  Baburin did not finish his sentence but I
mentally finished it for him it follows that Im a boy

Goodbye I said aloud and I retired

I was just going out of the courtyard into the street  Musa suddenly
ran out of the house and slipping a piece of crumpled paper into my
hand disappeared at once At the first lamppost I unfolded the paper
It turned out to be a note With difficulty I deciphered the pale
pencilmarks For Gods sake Musa had written come tomorrow after
matins to the Alexandrovsky garden near the Kutafia tower I shall wait
for you dont refuse me dont make me miserable I simply must see you
There were no mistakes in spelling in this note but neither was there
any punctuation I returned home in perplexity

                                   

When a quarter of an hour before the appointed time next day I began
to get near the Kutafia tower it was early in April the buds were
swelling the grass was growing greener and the sparrows were noisily
chirrupping and quarrelling in the bare lilac bushes considerably to
my surprise I caught sight of Musa a little to one side not far from
the fence She was there before me I was going towards her but she
herself came to meet me

Lets go to the Kreml wall she whispered in a hurried voice running
her downcast eyes over the ground there are people here

We went along the path up the hill

Musa Pavlovna I was beginning But she cut me short at once

Please she began speaking in the same jerky and subdued voice
dont criticise me dont think any harm of me I wrote a letter to
you I made an appointment to meet you because  I was afraid It
seemed to me yesterdayyou seemed to be laughing all the time
Listen she added with sudden energy and she stopped short and turned
towards me listen if you tell with whom  if you mention at whose
room you met me Ill throw myself in the water Ill drown myself Ill
make an end of myself

At this point for the first time she glanced at me with the
inquisitive piercing look I had seen before

Why she perhaps really  would do it was my thought

Really Musa Pavlovna I protested hurriedly how can you have such
a bad opinion of me Do you suppose I am capable of betraying my friend
and injuring you Besides come to that theres nothing in your
relations as far as Im aware deserving of censure For goodness
sake be calm

Musa heard me out without stirring from the spot or looking at me
again

Theres something else I ought to tell you she began moving forward
again along the path or else you may think Im quite mad I ought to
tell you that old man wants to marry me

What old man The bald one Punin

Nonot he The other  Paramon Semyonitch

Baburin

Yes

Is it possible Has he made you an offer

Yes

But you didnt consent of course

Yes I did consent  because I didnt understand what I was about
then Now its a different matter

I flung up my hands Baburinand you Why he must be fifty

He says fortythree But that makes no difference If he were
fiveandtwenty I wouldnt marry him Much happiness I should find in
it A whole week will go by without his smiling once Paramon Semyonitch
is my benefactor I am deeply indebted to him he took care of me
educated me I should have been utterly lost but for him Im bound to
look on him as a father But be his wife Id rather die Id rather
be in my coffin

Why do you keep talking about death Musa Pavlovna

Musa stopped again

Why is life so sweet then Even your friend Vladimir Nikolaitch I
may say Ive come to love from being wretched and dull and then
Paramon Semyonitch with his offers of marriage Punin though he
bores me with his verses he doesnt scare me anyway he doesnt make
me read Karamzin in the evenings when my heads ready to drop off my
shoulders for weariness And what are these old men to me They call me
cold too With them is it likely I should be warm If they try to make
meI shall go Paramon Semyonitch himselfs always saying Freedom
freedom All right I want freedom too Or else it comes to this
Freedom for every one else and keeping me in a cage Ill tell him so
myself But if you betray me or drop a hintremember theyll never
set eyes on me again

Musa stood in the middle of the path

Theyll never set eyes on me again she repeated sharply This time
too she did not raise her eyes to me she seemed to be aware that she
would infallibly betray herself would show what was in her heart if
any one looked her straight in the face And that was just why she
did not lift her eyes except when she was angry or annoyed and then
she stared straight at the person she was speaking to But her small
pretty face was aglow with indomitable resolution

Why Tarhov was right flashed through my head this girl is a
new type

Youve no need to be afraid of me I declared at last

Truly Even if  You said something about our relations But even
if there were  she broke off

Even in that case you would have no need to be afraid Musa Pavlovna
I am not your judge Your secret is buried here I pointed to my bosom
Believe me I know how to appreciate 

Have you got my letter Musa asked suddenly

Yes

Where

In my pocket

Give it here  quick quick

I got out the scrap of paper Musa snatched it in her rough little hand
stood still a moment facing me as though she were going to thank me
but suddenly started looked round and without even a word at parting
ran quickly down the hill

I looked in the direction she had taken At no great distance from the
tower I discerned wrapped in an Almaviva Almavivas were then in
the height of fashion a figure which I recognised at once as Tarhov

Aha my boy thought I you must have had notice then since youre
on the lookout

And whistling to myself I started homewards

                                   

Next morning I had only just drunk my morning tea when Punin made his
appearance He came into my room with rather an embarrassed face and
began making bows looking about him and apologising for his intrusion
as he called it I made haste to reassure him I sinful man imagined
that Punin had come with the intention of borrowing money But he
confined himself to asking for a glass of tea with rum in it as
luckily the samovar had not been cleared away Its with some
trepidation and sinking of heart that I have come to see you he said
as he nibbled a lump of sugar You I do not fear but I stand in awe of
your honoured grandmother I am abashed too by my attire as I have
already communicated to you Punin passed his finger along the frayed
edge of his ancient coat At home its no matter and in the street
too its no harm but when one finds ones self in gilded palaces
ones poverty stares one in the face and one feels confused I
occupied two small rooms on the ground floor and certainly it would
never have entered any ones head to call them palaces still less
gilded but Punin apparently was referring to the whole of my
grandmothers house though that too was by no means conspicuously
sumptuous He reproached me for not having been to see them the previous
day Paramon Semyonitch said he expected you though he did declare
that you would be sure not to come And Musotchka too expected you

What Musa Pavlovna too I queried

She too Shes a charming girl we have got with us isnt she What
do you say

Very charming I assented Punin rubbed his bare head with
extraordinary rapidity

Shes a beauty sir a pearl or even a diamondits the truth I am
telling you He bent down quite to my ear Noble blood too he
whispered to me onlyyou understandlefthanded the forbidden fruit
was eaten Well the parents died the relations would do nothing for
her and flung her to the hazards of destiny thats to say despair
dying of hunger But at that point Paramon Semyonitch steps forward
known as a deliverer from of old He took her clothed her and cared for
her brought up the poor nestling and she has blossomed into our
darling I tell you a man of the rarest qualities

Punin subsided against the back of the armchair lifted his hands and
again bending forward began whispering again but still more
mysteriously You see Paramon Semyonitch himself too Didnt you
know he too is of exalted extractionand on the left side too They
do sayhis father was a powerful Georgian prince of the line of King
David What do you make of that A few wordsbut how much is said
The blood of King David What do you think of that And according to
other accounts the founder of the family of Paramon Semyonitch was an
Indian Shah Babur Blue blood Thats fine too isnt it Eh

Well I queried and was he too Baburin flung to the hazards
of destiny

Punin rubbed his pate again To be sure he was And with even greater
cruelty than our little lady From his earliest childhood nothing but
struggling And in fact I will confess that inspired by Ruban I
composed in allusion to this fact a stanza for the portrait of Paramon
Semyonitch Wait a bit  how was it Yes

  Een from the cradle fates remorseless blows
  Baburin drove towards the abyss of woes
  But as in darkness gleams the light so now
  The conquerors laurel wreathes his noble brow

Punin delivered these lines in a rhythmic singsong voice with full
rounded vowels as verses should be read

So thats how it is hes a republican I exclaimed

No thats not why Punin answered simply He forgave his father long
ago but he cannot endure injustice of any sort its the sorrows of
others that trouble him

I wanted to turn the conversation on what I had learned from Musa the
day before that is to say on Baburins matrimonial projectbut I did
not know how to proceed Punin himself got me out of the difficulty

Did you notice nothing he asked me suddenly slily screwing up his
eyes while you were with us nothing special

Why was there anything to notice I asked in my turn

Punin looked over his shoulder as though anxious to satisfy himself
that no one was listening Our little beauty Musotchka is shortly to
be a married lady

How so

Madame Baburin Punin announced with an effort and slapping his
knees several times with his open hands he nodded his head like a
china mandarin

Impossible I cried with assumed astonishment Punins head
slowly came to rest and his hands dropped down Why impossible
allow me to ask

Because Paramon Semyonitch is more fit to be your young ladys father
because such a difference in age excludes all likelihood of loveon the
girls side

Excludes Punin repeated excitedly But what about gratitude and
pure affection and tenderness of feeling Excludes You must consider
this admitting that Musas a splendid girl but then to gain Paramon
Semyonitchs affection to be his comfort his prophis spouse in
short is that not the loftiest possible happiness even for such a girl
And she realises it You should look turn an attentive eye In Paramon
Semyonitchs presence Musotchka is all veneration all tremor and
enthusiasm

Thats just whats wrong Nikander Vavilitch that she is as you say
all tremor If you love any one you dont feel tremors in their
presence

But with that I cant agree Here am I for instance no one I
suppose could love Paramon Semyonitch more than I but I  tremble
before him

Oh youthats a different matter

How is it a different matter how how interrupted Punin I simply
did not know him he got hot and serious almost angry and quite
dropped his rhythmic singsong in speaking No he declared I notice
that you have not a good eye for character No you cant read peoples
hearts I gave up contradicting him  and to give another turn to the
conversation proposed for the sake of old times that we should read
something together

Punin was silent for a while

One of the old poets The real ones he asked at last

No a new one

A new one Punin repeated mistrustfully

Pushkin I answered I suddenly thought of the Gypsies which Tarhov
had mentioned not long before There by the way is the ballad about
the old husband Punin grumbled a little but I sat him down on the
sofa so that he could listen more comfortably and began to read
Pushkins poem The passage came at last old husband cruel husband
Punin heard the ballad through to the end and all at once he got up
impulsively

I cant he pronounced with an intense emotion which impressed even
meexcuse me I cannot hear more of that author He is an immoral
slanderer he is a liar  he upsets me I cannot Permit me to cut
short my visit today

I began trying to persuade Punin to remain but he insisted on having
his own way with a sort of stupid scared obstinacy he repeated several
times that he felt upset and wished to get a breath of fresh airand
all the while his lips were faintly quivering and his eyes avoided mine
as though I had wounded him So he went away A little while after I
too went out of the house and set off to see Tarhov

                                   

Without inquiring of any one with a students usual lack of ceremony
I walked straight into his lodgings In the first room there was no
one I called Tarhov by name and receiving no answer was just going
to retreat but the door of the adjoining room opened and my friend
appeared He looked at me rather queerly and shook hands without
speaking I had come to him to repeat all I had heard from Punin and
though I felt at once that I had called on Tarhov at the wrong moment
still after talking a little about extraneous matters I ended by
informing him of Baburins intentions in regard to Musa This piece of
news did not apparently surprise him much he quietly sat down at the
table and fixing his eyes intently upon me and keeping silent as
before gave to his features an expression  an expression as though
he would say Well what more have you to tell Come out with your
ideas I looked more attentively into his face It struck me as
eager a little ironical a little arrogant even But that did not
hinder me from bringing out my ideas On the contrary Youre showing
off was my thought so I am not going to spare you And there and
then I proceeded straightway to enlarge upon the mischief of yielding
to impulsive feelings upon the duty of every man to respect the
freedom and personal life of another manin short I proceeded to
enunciate useful and appropriate counsel Holding forth in this manner
I walked up and down the room to be more at ease Tarhov did not
interrupt me and did not stir from his seat he only played with his
fingers on his chin

I know said I  Exactly what was my motive in speaking so I have
no clear idea myselfenvy most likely it was not devotion to
morality anyway I know said I that its no easy matter no
joking matter I am sure you love Musa and that Musa loves youthat it
is not a passing fancy on your part But see let us suppose Here
I folded my arms on my breast  Let us suppose you gratify your
passionwhat is to follow You wont marry her you know And at the
same time you are wrecking the happiness of an excellent honest man
her benefactorandwho knows here my face expressed at the same time
penetration and sorrowpossibly her own happiness too

And so on and so on

For about a quarter of an hour my discourse flowed on Tarhov was still
silent I began to be disconcerted by this silence I glanced at him
from time to time not so much to satisfy myself as to the impression my
words were making on him as to find out why he neither objected nor
agreed but sat like a deaf mute At last I fancied that there was 
yes there certainly was a change in his face It began to show signs of
uneasiness agitation painful agitation Yet strange to say the
eager bright laughing something which had struck me at my first
glance at Tarhov still did not leave that agitated that troubled face
I could not make up my mind whether or no to congratulate myself on the
success of my sermon when Tarhov suddenly got up and pressing both my
hands said speaking very quickly Thank you thank you Youre right
of course  though on the other side one might observe  What is
your Baburin you make so much of after all An honest fooland nothing
more You call him a republicanand hes simply a fool Oo Thats what
he is All his republicanism simply means that he can never get on
anywhere

Ah so thats your idea A fool can never get onbut let me tell
you I pursued with sudden heat let me tell you my dear Vladimir
Nikolaitch that in these days to get on nowhere is a sign of a fine a
noble nature None but worthless peoplebad peopleget on anywhere and
accommodate themselves to everything You say Baburin is an honest fool
Why is it better then to your mind to be dishonest and clever

You distort my words cried Tarhov I only wanted to explain how I
understand that person Do you think hes such a rare specimen Not a
bit of it Ive met other people like him in my time A man sits with an
air of importance silent obstinate angular Ohoho say you It
shows that theres a great deal in him But theres nothing in him not
one idea in his headnothing but a sense of his own dignity

Even if there is nothing else thats an honourable thing I broke
in But let me ask where you have managed to study him like this You
dont know him do you Or are you describing him  from what Musa
tells you

Tarhov shrugged his shoulders Musa and I  have other things to talk
of I tell you what he added his whole body quivering with
impatienceI tell you what if Baburin has such a noble and honest
nature how is it he doesnt see that Musa is not a fit match for him
Its one of two things either he knows that what hes doing to her is
something of the nature of an outrage all in the name of gratitude 
and if so what about his honestyor he doesnt realise it  and in
that case what can one call him but a fool

I was about to reply but Tarhov again clutched my hands and again
began talking in a hurried voice Though  of course  I confess
you are right a thousand times right You are a true friend  but
now leave me alone please

I was puzzled Leave you alone

Yes I must dont you see think over all youve just said
thoroughly I have no doubt you are right  but now leave me
alone

You re in such a state of excitement  I was beginning

Excitement I Tarhov laughed but instantly pulled himself up Yes
of course I am How could I help being You say yourself its no joking
matter Yes I must think about it  alone He was still squeezing my
hands Goodbye my dear fellow goodbye

Goodbye I repeated Goodbye old boy As I was going away I flung
a last glance at Tarhov He seemed pleased At what At the fact that I
like a true friend and comrade had pointed out the danger of the way
upon which he had set his footor that I was going Ideas of the most
diverse kind were floating in my head the whole day till eveningtill
the very instant when I entered the house occupied by Punin and Baburin
for I went to see them the same day I am bound to confess that some of
Tarhovs phrases had sunk deep into my soul  and were ringing in my
ears In truth was it possible Baburin  was it possible he did
not see she was not a fit match for him

But could this possibly be Baburin the selfsacrificing Baburinan
honest fool

                                   

Punin had said when he came to see me that I had been expected there
the day before That may have been so but on this day it is certain
no one expected me I found every one at home and every one was
surprised at my visit Baburin and Punin were both unwell Punin had a
headache and he was lying curled up on the sofa with his head tied up
in a spotted handkerchief and strips of cucumber applied to his
temples Baburin was suffering from a bilious attack all yellow
almost dusky with dark rings round his eyes with scowling brow and
unshaven chinhe did not look much like a bridegroom I tried to go
away But they would not let me go and even made tea I spent
anything but a cheerful evening Musa it is true had no ailment and
was less shy than usual too but she was obviously vexed angry At
last she could not restrain herself and as she handed me a cup of
tea she whispered hurriedly You can say what you like you may try
your utmost you wont make any difference So there I looked at
her in astonishment and seizing a favourable moment asked her also
in a whisper Whats the meaning of your words Ill tell you she
answered and her black eyes gleaming angrily under her frowning
brows were fastened for an instant on my face and turned away at
once the meaning is that I heard all you said there today and thank
you for nothing and things wont be as you d have them anyway You
were there broke from me unconsciously But at this point
Baburins attention was caught and he glanced in our direction Musa
walked away from me

Ten minutes later she managed to come near me again She seemed to enjoy
saying bold and dangerous things to me and saying them in the presence
of her protector under his vigilant eye only exercising barely enough
caution not to arouse his suspicions It is well known that walking on
the brink on the very edge of the precipice is womans favourite
pastime Yes I was there whispered Musa without any change of
countenance except that her nostrils were faintly quivering and her
lips twitching Yes and if Paramon Semyonitch asks me what I am
whispering about with you Id tell him this minute What do I care

Be more careful I besought her I really believe they are noticing

I tell you Im quite ready to tell them everything And whos
noticing Ones stretching his neck off the pillow like a sick duck
and hears nothing and the others deep in philosophy Dont you be
afraid Musas voice rose a little and her cheeks gradually flushed a
sort of malignant dusky red and this suited her marvellously and
never had she been so pretty As she cleared the table and set the cups
and saucers in their places she moved swiftly about the room there was
something challenging about her light free and easy movement You may
criticise me as you like she seemed to say but Im going my own way
and Im not afraid of you

I cannot disguise the fact that I found Musa bewitching just that
evening Yes I mused shes a little spitfireshes a new type
Shesexquisite Those hands know how to deal a blow I dare say
What of it No matter

Paramon Semyonitch she cried suddenly isnt a republic an empire in
which every one does as he chooses

A republic is not an empire answered Baburin raising his head and
contracting his brows it is a  form of society in which everything
rests on law and justice

Then Musa pursued in a republic no one can oppress any one else

No

And every one is free to dispose of himself

Quite free

Ah thats all I wanted to know

Why do you want to know

Oh I wanted toI wanted you to tell me that

Our young lady is anxious to learn Punin observed from the sofa

When I went out into the passage Musa accompanied me not of course
from politeness but with the same malicious intent I asked her as I
took leave Can you really love him so much

Whether I love him or whether I dont thats my affair she
answered What is to be will be

Mind what youre about dont play with fire  youll get burnt

Better be burnt than frozen You  with your good advice And how can
you tell he wont marry me How do you know I so particularly want to
get married If I am ruined  what business is it of yours

She slammed the door after me

I remember that on the way home I reflected with some pleasure that my
friend Vladimir Tarhov might find things rather hot for him with his new
type He ought to have to pay something for his happiness

That he would be happy I wasregretfullyunable to doubt

Three days passed by I was sitting in my room at my writingtable and
not so much working as getting myself ready for lunch I heard a
rustle lifted my head and I was stupefied Before merigid terrible
white as chalk stood an apparition  Punin His halfclosed eyes were
looking at me blinking slowly they expressed a senseless terror the
terror of a frightened hare and his arms hung at his sides like sticks

Nikander Vavilitch what is the matter with you How did you come here
Did no one see you What has happened Do speak

She has run away Punin articulated in a hoarse hardly audible voice

What do you say

She has run away he repeated

Who

Musa She went away in the night and left a note

A note

Yes I thank you she said but I am not coming back again Dont
look for me We ran up and down we questioned the cook she knew
nothing I cant speak loud you must excuse me Ive lost my voice

Musa Pavlovna has left you I exclaimed Nonsense Mr Baburin must
be in despair What does he intend to do now

He has no intention of doing anything I wanted to run to the
Governorgeneral he forbade it I wanted to give information to the
police he forbade that too and got very angry He says Shes free
 He says I dont want to constrain her He has even gone to work to
his office But he looks more dead than alive He loved her
terriblyOh oh we both loved her

Here Punin for the first time showed that he was not a wooden image but
a live man he lifted both his fists in the air and brought them down
on his pate which shone like ivory

Ungrateful girl he groaned who was it gave you food and drink
clothed you and brought you up who cared for you would have given all
his life all his soul  And you have forgotten it all To cast me
off truly were no great matter but Paramon Semyonitch Paramon 

I begged him to sit down to rest

Punin shook his head No I wont I have come to you  I dont know
what for Im like one distraught to stay at home alone is fearful
what am I to do with myself I stand in the middle of the room shut my
eyes and call Musa Musotchka Thats the way to go out of ones
mind But no why am I talking nonsense I know why I have come to you
You know the other day you read me that thriceaccursed poem  you
remember where there is talk of an old husband What did you do that
for Did you know something then  or guessed something Punin
glanced at me Piotr Petrovitch he cried suddenly and he began
trembling all over you know perhaps where she is Kind friend tell
me whom she has gone to

I was disconcerted and could not help dropping my eyes

Perhaps she said something in her letter I began

She said she was leaving us because she loved some one else Dear good
friend you know surely where she is Save her let us go to her we
will persuade her Only think what a man shes bringing to ruin

Punin all at once flushed crimson the blood seemed to rush to his
head he plumped heavily down on his knees Save us friend let us
go to her

My servant appeared in the doorway and stood still in amazement

I had no little trouble to get Punin on to his feet again to convince
him that even if I did suspect something still it would not do to act
like that on the spur of the moment especially both togetherthat
would only spoil all our effortsthat I was ready to do my best but
would not answer for anything Punin did not oppose me nor did he
indeed hear me he only repeated from time to time in his broken voice
Save her save her and Paramon Semyonitch At last he began to cry
Tell me at least one thing he asked  is he handsome young

Yes he is young I answered

He is young repeated Punin smearing the tears over his cheeks and
she is young Its from that that all the troubles sprung

This rhyme came by chance poor Punin was in no mood for versifying I
would have given a good deal to hear his rhapsodical eloquence again or
even his almost noiseless laugh Alas his eloquence was quenched for
ever and I never heard his laugh again

I promised to let him know as soon as I should find out anything
positive Tarhovs name I did not however mention Punin suddenly
collapsed completely Very good very good sir thank you he said
with a pitiful face using the word sir which he had never done
before only mind sir do not say anything to Paramon Semyonitch 
or hell be angry In one word he has forbidden it Goodbye sir

As he got up and turned his back to me Punin struck me as such a poor
feeble creature that I positively marvelled he limped with both legs
and doubled up at each step

Its a bad lookout Its the end of him thats what it means
I thought

                                   

Though I had promised Punin to trace Musa yet as I set off the same day
to Tarhovs I had not the slightest expectation of learning anything
as I considered it certain that either I should not find him at home or
that he would refuse to see me My supposition turned out to be a
mistaken one I found Tarhov at home he received me and I found out
indeed all I wanted to know but there was nothing gained by that
Directly I crossed the threshold of his door Tarhov came resolutely
rapidly to meet me and his eyes sparkling and glowing his face grown
handsomer and radiant he said firmly and briskly Listen Petya my
boy I guess what youve come for and what you want to talk about but
I give you warning if you say a single word about her or about her
action or about what according to you is the course dictated to me by
common sense were friends no longer were not even acquainted and I
shall beg you to treat me as a stranger

I looked at Tarhov he was quivering all over inwardly like a tightly
drawn harpstring he was tingling all over hardly could he hold back
the tide of brimming youth and passion violent ecstatic happiness had
burst into his soul and had taken full possession of himand he of it

                                   

Is that your final decision I pronounced mournfully

Yes Petya my boy its final

In that case theres nothing for me but to say goodbye

Tarhov faintly dropped his eyelids He was too happy at that moment

Goodbye Petya old boy he said a little through his nose with a
candid smile and a gay flash of all his white teeth

What was I to do I left him to his happiness As I slammed the door
after me the other door of the room slammed alsoI heard it

                                   

It was with a heavy heart that I trudged off next day to see my luckless
acquaintances I secretly hopedsuch is human weaknessthat I should
not find them at home and again I was mistaken Both were at home The
change that had taken place in them during the last three days must have
struck any one Punin looked ghastly white and flabby His talkativeness
had completely vanished He spoke listlessly feebly still in the same
husky voice and looked somehow lost and bewildered Baburin on the
contrary seemed shrunk into himself and blacker than ever taciturn at
the best of times he uttered nothing now but a few abrupt sounds an
expression of stony severity seemed to have frozen on his countenance

I felt it impossible to be silent but what was there to say I confined
myself to whispering to Punin I have discovered nothing and my advice
to you is to give up all hope Punin glanced at me with his swollen
red little eyesthe only red left in his facemuttered something
inaudible and hobbled away Baburin most likely guessed what I had been
speaking about to Punin and opening his lips which were tightly
compressed as though glued together he pronounced in a deliberate
voice My dear sir since your last visit to us something disagreeable
has happened to us our young friend Musa Pavlovna Vinogradov finding
it no longer convenient to live with us has decided to leave us and
has given us a written communication to that effect Not considering
that we have any right to hinder her doing so we have left her to act
according to her own views of what is best We trust that she may be
happy he added with some effort and I humbly beg you not to allude
to the subject as any such references are useless and even painful

So he too like Tarhov forbids my speaking of Musa was the thought
that struck me and I could not help wondering inwardly He might well
prize Zeno so highly I wished to impart to him some facts about that
sage but my tongue would not form the words and it did well

I soon went about my business At parting neither Punin nor Baburin
said Till we meet both with one voice pronounced Goodbye

Punin even returned me a volume of the Telegraph I had brought him as
much as to say he had no need of anything of that kind now

A week later I had a curious encounter An early spring had set in
abruptly at midday the heat rose to eighteen degrees Raumur
Everything was turning green and shooting up out of the spongy damp
earth I hired a horse at the ridingschool and went out for a ride
into the outskirts of the town towards the Vorobyov hills On the road
I was met by a little cart drawn by a pair of spirited ponies
splashed with mud up to their ears with plaited tails and red ribbons
in their manes and forelocks Their harness was such as sportsmen
affect with copper discs and tassels they were being driven by a
smart young driver in a blue tunic without sleeves a yellow striped
silk shirt and a low felt hat with peacocks feathers round the crown
Beside him sat a girl of the artisan or merchant class in a flowered
silk jacket with a big blue handkerchief on her headand she was
simply bubbling over with mirth The driver was laughing too I drew my
horse on one side but did not however take particular notice of the
swiftly passing merry couple when all at once the young man shouted
to his ponies Why that was Tarhovs voice I looked round Yes
it was he unmistakably he dressed up as a peasant and beside
himwasnt it Musa

But at that instant their ponies quickened their pace and they were
out of my sight in a minute I tried to put my horse into a gallop
in pursuit of them but it was an old riding school hack that
shambled from side to side as it moved it went more slowly
galloping than trotting

Enjoy yourselves my dear friends I muttered through my teeth

I ought to observe that I had not seen Tarhov during the whole week
though I had been three times to his rooms He was never at home
Baburin and Punin I had not seen either I had not been to see them

I caught cold on my ride though it was very warm there was a piercing
wind I was dangerously ill and when I recovered I went with my
grandmother into the country to feed up by the doctors advice I did
not get to Moscow again in the autumn I was transferred to the
Petersburg university




III




Not seven but fully twelve years had passed by and I was in my
thirtysecond year My grandmother had long been dead I was living in
Petersburg with a post in the Department of Home Affairs Tarhov I had
lost sight of he had gone into the army and lived almost always in the
provinces We had met twice as old friends glad to see each other but
we had not touched on the past in our talk At the time of our last
meeting he was if I remember right already a married man

One sultry summer day I was sauntering along Gorohov Street cursing
my official duties for keeping me in Petersburg and the heat and
stench and dust of the city A funeral barred my way It consisted of
a solitary car that is to be accurate of a decrepit hearse on
which a poorlooking wooden coffin halfcovered with a threadbare
black cloth was shaking up and down as it was jolted violently over
the uneven pavement An old man with a white head was walking alone
after the hearse

I looked at him His face seemed familiar He too turned his eyes
upon me Merciful heavens it was Baburin I took off my hat went up
to him mentioned my name and walked along beside him

Whom are you burying I asked

Nikander Vavilitch Punin he answered

I felt I knew beforehand that he would utter that name and yet it set
my heart aching I felt melancholy and yet I was glad that chance had
enabled me to pay my last respects to my old friend

May I go with you Paramon Semyonitch

You may I was following him alone now therell be two of us

Our walk lasted more than an hour My companion moved forward without
lifting his eyes or opening his lips He had become quite an old man
since I had seen him last his deeply furrowed coppercoloured face
stood out sharply against his white hair Signs of a life of toil and
suffering of continual struggle could be seen in Baburins whole
figure want and poverty had worked cruel havoc with him When
everything was over when what was Punin had disappeared for ever in the
damp  yes undoubtedly damp earth of the Smolensky cemetery Baburin
after standing a couple of minutes with bowed uncovered head before the
newly risen mound of sandy clay turned to me his emaciated as it were
embittered face his dry sunken eyes thanked me grimly and was about
to move away but I detained him

Where do you live Paramon Semyonitch Let me come and see you I had
no idea you were living in Petersburg We could recall old days and
talk of our dead friend

Baburin did not answer me at once

Its two years since I found my way to Petersburg he observed at
last I live at the very end of the town However if you really care
to visit me come He gave me his address Come in the evening in the
evening we are always at home  both of us

Both of you

I am married My wife is not very well today and thats why she
did not come too Though indeed its quite enough for one person to
go through this empty formality this ceremony As if anybody
believed in it all

I was a little surprised at Baburins last words but I said nothing
called a cab and proposed to Baburin to take him home but he refused

                                   

The same day I went in the evening to see him All the way there I was
thinking of Punin I recalled how I had met him the first time and how
ecstatic and amusing he was in those days and afterwards in Moscow how
subdued he had grownespecially the last time I saw him and now he had
made his last reckoning with lifelife is in grim earnest it seems
Baburin was living in the Viborgsky quarter in a little house which
reminded me of the Moscow nest the Petersburg abode was almost
shabbier in appearance When I went into his room he was sitting on a
chair in a corner with his hands on his knees a tallow candle burning
low dimly lighted up his bowed white head He heard the sound of my
footsteps started up and welcomed me more warmly than I had expected
A few moments later his wife came in I recognised her at once as
Musaand only then understood why Baburin had invited me to come he
wanted to show me that he had after all come by his own

Musa was greatly changedin face in voice and in manners but her
eyes were changed most of all In old times they had darted about like
live creatures those malicious beautiful eyes they had gleamed
stealthily but brilliantly their glance had pierced like a
pinprick Now they looked at one directly calmly steadily their
black centres had lost their lustre I am broken in I am tame I am
good her soft and dull gaze seemed to say Her continued submissive
smile told the same story And her dress too was subdued brown with
little spots on it She came up to me asked me whether I knew her She
obviously felt no embarrassment and not because she had lost a sense of
shame or memory of the past but simply because all petty
selfconsciousness had left her

Musa talked a great deal about Punin talked in an even voice which too
had lost its fire I learned that of late years he had become very
feeble had almost sunk into childishness so much so that he was
miserable if he had not toys to play with they persuaded him it is
true that he made them out of waste stuff for sale  but he really
played with them himself His passion for poetry however never died
out and he kept his memory for nothing but verses a few days before
his death he recited a passage from the Rossiad but Pushkin he
feared as children fear bogies His devotion to Baburin had also
remained undiminished he worshipped him as much as ever and even at
the last wrapped about by the chill and dark of the end he had
faltered with halting tongue benefactor I learned also from Musa
that soon after the Moscow episode it had been Baburins fate once more
to wander all over Russia continually tossed from one private situation
to another that in Petersburg too he had been again in a situation
in a private business which situation he had however been obliged to
leave a few days before owing to some unpleasantness with his employer
Baburin had ventured to stand up for the workpeople The invariable
smile with which Musa accompanied her words set me musing mournfully
it put the finishing touch to the impression made on me by her husbands
appearance They had hard work the two of them to make a bare
livingthere was no doubt of it He took very little part in our
conversation he seemed more preoccupied than grieved Something was
worrying him

Paramon Semyonitch come here said the cook suddenly appearing in
the doorway

What is it whats wanted he asked in alarm

Come here the cook repeated insistently and meaningly Baburin
buttoned up his coat and went out

When I was left alone with Musa she looked at me with a somewhat
changed glance and observed in a voice which was also changed and with
no smile I dont know Piotr Petrovitch what you think of me now but
I dare say you remember what I used to be I was selfconfident
lighthearted  and not good I wanted to live for my own pleasure
But I want to tell you this when I was abandoned and was like one
lost and was only waiting for God to take me or to pluck up spirit to
make an end of myselfonce more just as in Voronezh I met with
Paramon Semyonitchand he saved me once again Not a word that could
wound me did I hear from him not a word of reproach he asked nothing
of meI was not worthy of that but he loved me  and I became his
wife What was I to do I had failed of dying and I could not live
either after my own choiceWhat was I to do with myself Even soit
was a mercy to be thankful for That is all

She ceased turned away for an instant  the same submissive smile
came back to her lips Whether lifes easy for me you neednt ask
was the meaning I fancied now in that smile

The conversation passed to ordinary subjects Musa told me that Punin
had left a cat that he had been very fond of and that ever since his
death she had gone up to the attic and stayed there mewing
incessantly as though she were calling some one  the neighbours
were very much scared and fancied that it was Punins soul that had
passed into the cat

Paramon Semyonitch is worried about something I said at last

Oh you noticed itMusa sighed He cannot help being worried I
need hardly tell you that Paramon Semyonitch has remained faithful to
his principles The present condition of affairs can but strengthen
them Musa expressed herself quite differently now from in the old
days in Moscow there was a literary bookish flavour in her phrases
I dont know though whether I can rely upon you and how you will
receive 

Why should you imagine you cannot rely upon me

Well you are in the government serviceyou are an official

Well what of that

You are consequently loyal to the government

I marvelled inwardly  at Musas innocence As to my attitude to the
government which is not even aware of my existence I wont enlarge
upon that I observed but you may set your mind at rest I will make
no bad use of your confidence I sympathise with your husbands
ideas  more than you suppose

Musa shook her head

Yes thats all so she began not without hesitation but you see
its like this Paramon Semyonitchs ideas will shortly it may be find
expression in action They can no longer be hidden under a bushel There
are comrades whom we cannot now abandon 

Musa suddenly ceased speaking as though she had bitten her tongue Her
last words had amazed and a little alarmed me Most likely my face
showed what I was feelingand Musa noticed it

As I have said already our interview took place in the year  Many
people still remember what a disturbed and difficult time that was and
by what incidents it was signalised in St Petersburg I had been struck
myself by certain peculiarities in Baburins behaviour in his whole
demeanour Twice he had referred to governmental action to personages
in high authority with such intense bitterness and hatred with such
loathing that I had been dumbfoundered

Well he asked me suddenly did you set your peasants free

I was obliged to confess I had not

Why I suppose your grannys dead isnt she

I was obliged to admit that she was

To be sure you noble gentlemen Baburin muttered between his teeth
 use other mens hands  to poke up your fire  thats what
you like

In the most conspicuous place in his room hung the wellknown lithograph
portrait of Belinsky on the table lay a volume of the old Polar Star
edited by Bestuzhev

A long time passed and Baburin did not come back after the cook had
called him away Musa looked several times uneasily towards the door by
which he had gone out At last she could bear it no longer she got up
and with an apology she too went out by the same door A quarter of an
hour later she came back with her husband the faces of both so at
least I thought looked troubled But all of a sudden Baburins face
assumed a different an intensely bitter almost frenzied expression

What will be the end of it he began all at once in a jerky sobbing
voice utterly unlike him while his wild eyes shifted restlessly about
him One goes on living and living and hoping that maybe itll be
better that one will breathe more freely but its quite the other
wayeverything gets worse and worse They have squeezed us right up
to the wall In my youth I bore all with patience they  maybe 
beat me  even  yes he added turning sharply round on his heels
and swooping down as it were upon me I a man of full age was
subjected to corporal punishment  yesof other wrongs I will not
speak But is there really nothing before us but to go back to those
old times again The way they are treating the young people now 
Yes it breaks down all endurance at last It breaks it down Yes
Wait a bit

I had never seen Baburin in such a condition Musa turned positively
white Baburin suddenly cleared his throat and sank down into a
seat Not wishing to constrain either him or Musa by my presence I
decided to go and was just saying goodbye to them when the door
into the next room suddenly opened and a head appeared It was not
the cooks head but the dishevelled and terrifiedlooking head of a
young man

Somethings wrong Baburin somethings wrong he faltered hurriedly
then vanished at once on perceiving my unfamiliar figure

Baburin rushed after the young man I pressed Musas hand warmly and
withdrew with presentiments of evil in my heart

Come tomorrow she whispered anxiously

I certainly will come I answered

                                   

I was still in bed next morning when my man handed me a letter
from Musa

Dear Piotr Petrovitch she wrote Paramon Semyonitch has been this
night arrested by the police and carried off to the fortress or I dont
know where they did not tell me They ransacked all our papers sealed
up a great many and took them away with them It has been the same with
our books and letters They say a mass of people have been arrested in
the town You can fancy how I feel It is well Nikander Vavilitch did
not live to see it He was taken just in time Advise me what I am to
do For myself I am not afraidI shall not die of starvationbut the
thought of Paramon Semyonitch gives me no rest Come please if only
you are not afraid to visit people in our positionYours faithfully

MUSA BABURIN

                                   

Half an hour later I was with Musa On seeing me she held out her
hand and though she did not utter a word a look of gratitude
flitted over her face She was wearing the same clothes as on the
previous day there was every sign that she had not been to bed or
slept all night Her eyes were red but from sleeplessness not from
tears She had not been crying She was in no mood for weeping She
wanted to act wanted to struggle with the calamity that had fallen
upon them the old energetic selfwilled Musa had risen up in her
again She had no time even to be indignant though she was choking
with indignation How to assist Baburin to whom to appeal so as to
soften his lotshe could think of nothing else She wanted to go
instantly  to petition  demand But where to go whom to
petition what to demandthis was what she wanted to hear from me
this was what she wanted to consult me about

I began by counselling her  to have patience For the first moment
there was nothing left to be done but to wait and as far as might be
to make inquiries and to take any decisive step now when the affair had
scarcely begun and hardly yet taken shape would be simply senseless
irrational To hope for any success was irrational even if I had been a
person of much more importance and influence  but what could I a
petty official do As for her she was absolutely without any powerful
friends

It was no easy matter to make all this plain to her  but at last she
understood my arguments she understood too that I was not prompted by
egoistic feeling when I showed her the uselessness of all efforts But
tell me Musa Pavlovna I began when she sank at last into a chair
till then she had been standing up as though on the point of setting
off at once to the aid of Baburin how Paramon Semyonitch at his age
comes to be mixed up in such an affair I feel sure that there are none
but young people implicated in it like the one who came in yesterday to
warn you

Those young people are our friends cried Musa and her eyes flashed
and darted as of old Something strong irrepressible seemed as it
were to rise up from the bottom of her soul  and I suddenly recalled
the expression a new type which Tarhov had once used of her Years
are of no consequence when it is a matter of political principles Musa
laid a special stress on these last two words One might fancy that in
all her sorrow it was not unpleasing to her to show herself before me in
this new unlookedfor characterin the character of a cultivated and
mature woman fit wife of a republican  Some old men are younger
than some young ones she pursued more capable of sacrifice But
thats not the point

I think Musa Pavlovna I observed that you are exaggerating a
little Knowing the character of Paramon Semyonitch I should have felt
sure beforehand that he would sympathise with every  sincere
impulse but on the other hand I have always regarded him as a man of
sense Surely he cannot fail to realise all the impracticability
all the absurdity of conspiracies in Russia In his position in his
calling 

Oh of course Musa interrupted with bitterness in her voice he is
a working man and in Russia it is only permissible for noblemen to take
part in conspiracies  as for instance in that of the fourteenth of
December  thats what you meant to say

In that case what do you complain of now almost broke from my
lips  but I restrained myself Do you consider that the result of
the fourteenth of December was such as to encourage other such
attempts I said aloud

Musa frowned It is no good talking to you about it was what I read
in her downcast face

Is Paramon Semyonitch very seriously compromised I ventured to ask
her Musa made no reply A hungry savage mewing was heard from
the attic

Musa started Ah it is a good thing Nikander Vavilitch did not see all
this she moaned almost despairingly He did not see how violently in
the night they seized his benefactor our benefactormaybe the best
and truest man in the whole worldhe did not see how they treated that
noble man at his age how rudely they addressed him  how they
threatened him and the threats they used to himonly because he was a
working man That young officer too was no doubt just such an
unprincipled heartless wretch as I have known in my life

Musas voice broke She was quivering all over like a leaf

Her longsuppressed indignation broke out at last old memories stirred
up brought to the surface by the general tumult of her soul showed
themselves alive within her But the conviction I carried off at that
moment was that the new type was still the same still the same
passionate impulsive nature Only the impulses by which Musa was
carried away were not the same as in the days of her youth What on my
first visit I had taken for resignation for meekness and what really
was sothe subdued lustreless glance the cold voice the quietness
and simplicityall that had significance only in relation to the past
to what would never return

Now it was the present asserted itself

I tried to soothe Musa tried to put our conversation on a more
practical level Some steps must be taken that could not be postponed
we must find out exactly where Baburin was and then secure both for him
and for Musa the means of subsistence All this presented no
inconsiderable difficulty what was needed was not to find money but
work which is as we all know a far more complicated problem

I left Musa with a perfect swarm of reflections in my head

I soon learned that Baburin was in the fortress

The proceedings began  dragged on I saw Musa several times every
week She had several interviews with her husband But just at the
moment of the decision of the whole melancholy affair I was not in
Petersburg Unforeseen business had obliged me to set off to the
south of Russia During my absence I heard that Baburin had been
acquitted at the trial it appeared that all that could be proved
against him was that young people regarding him as a person unlikely
to awaken suspicion had sometimes held meetings at his house and he
had been present at their meetings he was however by
administrative order sent into exile in one of the western provinces
of Siberia Musa went with him

Paramon Semyonitch did not wish it she wrote to me as according to
his ideas no one ought to sacrifice self for another person and not
for a cause but I told him there was no question of sacrifice at all
When I said to him in Moscow that I would be his wife I thought to
myselffor ever indissolubly So indissoluble it must be till the end
of our days




IV




Twelve more years passed by Every one in Russia knows and will ever
remember what passed between the years  and  In my personal
life too many changes took place on which however there is no need
to enlarge New interests came into it new cares The Baburin couple
first fell into the background then passed out of my mind altogether
Yet I kept up a correspondence with Musaat very long intervals
however Sometimes more than a year passed without any tidings of her or
of her husband I heard that soon after  he received permission to
return to Russia but that he preferred to remain in the little Siberian
town where he had been flung by destiny and where he had apparently
made himself a home and found a haven and a sphere of activity

And lo and behold towards the end of March in  I received the
following letter from Musa

It is so long since I have written to you most honoured Piotr
Petrovitch that I do not even know whether you are still living and if
you are living have you not forgotten our existence But no matter I
cannot resist writing to you today Everything till now has gone on
with us in the same old way Paramon Semyonitch and I have been always
busy with our schools which are gradually making good progress besides
that Paramon Semyonitch was taken up with reading and correspondence
and his usual discussions with the Oldbelievers members of the clergy
and Polish exiles his health has been fairly good So has mine But
yesterday the manifesto of the th of February reached us We had long
been on the lookout for it Rumours had reached us long before of what
was being done among you in Petersburg  but yet I cant describe what
it was You know my husband well he was not in the least changed by his
misfortune on the contrary he has grown even stronger and more
energetic and has a will as strong as iron but at this he could not
restrain himself His hands shook as he read it then he embraced me
three times and three times he kissed me tried to say somethingbut
no he could not and ended by bursting into tears which was very
astounding to see and suddenly he shouted Hurrah hurrah God save
the Tsar Yes Piotr Petrovitch those were his very words Then he
went on Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart  and again This is
the first step others are bound to follow it and just as he was
bareheaded ran to tell the great news to our friends There was a
bitter frost and even a snowstorm coming on I tried to prevent him
but he would not listen to me And when he came home he was all covered
with snow his hair his face and his beardhe has a beard right down
to his chest nowand the tears were positively frozen on his cheeks
But he was very lively and cheerful and told me to uncork a bottle of
homemade champagne and he drank with our friends that he had brought
back with him to the health of the Tsar and of Russia and all free
Russians and taking the glass and fixing his eyes on the ground he
said Nikander Nikander do you hear There are no slaves in Russia
any more Rejoice in the grave old comrade And much more he said to
the effect that his expectations were fulfilled He said too that
now there could be no turning back that this was in its way a pledge or
promise I dont remember everything but it is long since I have
seen him so happy And so I made up my mind to write to you so that you
might know how we have been rejoicing and exulting in the remote
Siberian wilds so that you might rejoice with us

This letter I received at the end of March At the beginning of May
another very brief letter arrived from Musa She informed me that her
husband Paramon Semyonitch Baburin had taken cold on the very day of
the arrival of the manifesto and died on the th of April of
inflammation of the lungs in the th year of his age She added that
she intended to remain where his body lay at rest and to go on with the
work he had bequeathed her since such was the last wish of Paramon
Semyonitch and that was her only law

Since then I have heard no more of Musa

OLD PORTRAITS




I


About thirty miles from our village there lived many years ago a
distant cousin of my mothers a retired officer of the Guards and
rather wealthy landowner Alexey Sergeitch Teliegin He lived on his
estate and birthplace Suhodol did not go out anywhere and so did not
visit us but I used to be sent twice a year to pay him my
respectsat first with my tutor but later on alone Alexey Sergeitch
always gave me a very cordial reception and I used to stay three or
four days at a time with him He was an old man even when I first made
his acquaintance I was twelve I remember on my first visit and he
was then over seventy He was born in the days of the Empress
Elisabethin the last year of her reign He lived alone with his wife
Malania Pavlovna she was ten years younger than he They had two
daughters but their daughters had been long married and rarely visited
Suhodol they were not on the best of terms with their parents and
Alexey Sergeitch hardly ever mentioned their names

I see even now the oldfashioned house a typical manorhouse of the
steppes One story in height with immense attics it was built at the
beginning of this century of amazingly thick beams of pinesuch beams
came in plenty in those days from the Zhizdrinsky pineforests they
have passed out of memory now It was very spacious and contained a
great number of rooms rather lowpitched and dark it is true the
windows in the walls had been made small for the sake of greater warmth
In the usual fashion I ought rather to say in what was then the usual
fashion the offices and houseserfs huts surrounded the manorial
house on all sides and the garden was close to ita small garden but
containing fine fruittrees juicy apples and pipless pears The flat
steppe of rich black earth stretched for ten miles round No lofty
object for the eye not a tree nor even a belfry somewhere maybe
jutting up a windmill with rents in its sails truly wellnamed
Suhodol or Dryflat Inside the house the rooms were filled with
ordinary simple furniture somewhat unusual was the milestonepost that
stood in the window of the drawingroom with the following
inscriptionIf you walk sixtyeight times round this drawingroom you
will have gone a mile if you walk eightyseven times from the furthest
corner of the parlour to the righthand corner of the billiardroom you
will have gone a mile and so on But what most of all impressed a
guest at the house for the first time was the immense collection of
pictures hanging on the walls for the most part works of the socalled
Italian masters all oldfashioned landscapes of a sort or mythological
and religious subjects But all these pictures were very dark and even
cracked with agein one all that met the eye was some patches of
fleshcolour in another undulating red draperies on an unseen body or
an arch which seemed to be suspended in the air or a dishevelled tree
with blue foliage or the bosom of a nymph with an immense breast like
the lid of a souptureen a cut watermelon with black seeds a turban
with a feather in it above a horses head or the gigantic brown leg of
an apostle suddenly thrust out with a muscular calf and toes turned
upwards In the drawingroom in the place of honour hung a portrait of
the Empress Catherine II full length a copy of the famous portrait by
Lampian object of the special reverence one might say the adoration
of the master of the house From the ceiling hung glass lustres in
bronze settings very small and very dusty

Alexey Sergeitch himself was a stumpy paunchy little old man with a
chubby face of one uniform tint yet pleasant with drawnin lips and
very lively little eyes under high eyebrows He wore his scanty locks
combed to the back of his head it was only since  that he had given
up wearing powder Alexey Sergeitch invariably wore a grey redingote
with three capes falling over his shoulders a striped waistcoat
chamoisleather breeches and high boots of dark red morocco with
heartshaped scallops and tassels at the tops he wore a white muslin
cravat a jabot lace cuffs and two gold English turnip watches one
in each pocket of his waistcoat In his right hand he usually carried an
enamelled snuffbox full of Spanish snuff and his left hand leaned on
a cane with a silverchased knob worn smooth by long use Alexey
Sergeitch had a little nasal piping voice and an invariable
smilekindly but as it were condescending and not without a certain
selfcomplacent dignity His laugh too was kindlya shrill little
laugh that tinkled like glass beads Courteous and affable he was to the
last degreein the oldfashioned manner of the days of Catherineand
he moved his hands with slow rounded gestures also in the old style
His legs were so weak that he could not walk but ran with hurried
little steps from one armchair to another in which he would suddenly
sit down or rather fall softly like a cushion

As I have said already Alexey Sergeitch went out nowhere and saw very
little of his neighbours though he liked society for he was very fond
of talking It is true that he had society in plenty in his own house
various Nikanor Nikanoritchs Sevastiey Sevastietchs Fedulitchs
Miheitchs all poor gentlemen in shabby cossack coats and camisoles
often from the masters wardrobe lived under his roof to say nothing
of the poor gentlewomen in chintz gowns black kerchiefs thrown over
their shoulders and worsted reticules in their tightly clenched
fingersall sorts of Avdotia Savishnas Pelagea Mironovnas and plain
Feklushkas and Arinkas who found a home in the womens quarters Never
less than fifteen persons sat down to Alexey Sergeitchs table He
was such a hospitable man Among all those dependants two were
particularly conspicuous a dwarf nicknamed Janus or the Doublefaced
of Danishor as some maintained Jewishextraction and the mad
Prince L Contrary to what was customary in those days the dwarf did
nothing to amuse the master or mistress and was not a jesterquite the
opposite he was always silent had an illtempered and sullen
appearance and scowled and gnashed his teeth directly a question was
addressed to him Alexey Sergeitch called him a philosopher and
positively respected him at table the dishes were handed to him first
after the guests and master and mistress God has afflicted him
Alexey Sergeitch used to say such is His Divine will but its not for
me to afflict him further How is he a philosopher I asked him once
Janus didnt take to me if I went near him he would fly into a rage
and mutter thickly Stranger keep off Eh God bless me isnt he a
philosopher answered Alexey Sergeitch Look ye little sir how
wisely he holds his tongue But why is he doublefaced Because
little sir he has one face on the outsideand so you surfacegazers
judge him But the other the real face he hides And that face I
know and no one elseand I love him for it  because that face is
good You for instance look and see nothing  but I see without a
word he is blaming me for something for hes a severe critic And its
always with good reason That little sir you cant understand but you
may believe an old man like me The real history of the twofaced
Januswhere he came from and how he came into Alexey Sergeitchs
handsno one knew but the story of Prince L was well known to every
one He went a lad of twenty of a wealthy and distinguished family to
Petersburg to serve in a regiment of the Guards At the first levee the
Empress Catherine noticed him stood still before him and pointing at
him with her fan she said aloud addressing one of her courtiers who
happened to be near Look Adam Vassilievitch what a pretty fellow a
perfect doll The poor boys head was completely turned when he got
home he ordered his coach out and putting on a ribbon of St Anne
proceeded to drive all over the town as though he had reached the
pinnacle of fortune Drive over every one he shouted to his coachman
who does not move out of the way All this was promptly reported to
the empress the decree went forth that he should be declared insane
and put under the guardianship of two of his brothers and they without
a moments delay carried him off to the country and flung him into a
stone cell in chains As they wanted to get the benefit of his property
they did not let the poor wretch out even when he had completely
recovered his balance and positively kept him locked up till he really
did go out of his mind But their evil doings did not prosper Prince L
outlived his brothers and after long years of adversity he came into
the charge of Alexey Sergeitch whose kinsman he was He was a stout
completely bald man with a long thin nose and prominent blue eyes He
had quite forgotten how to talkhe simply uttered a sort of
inarticulate grumbling but he sang oldfashioned Russian ballads
beautifully preserving the silvery freshness of his voice to extreme
old age and while he was singing he pronounced each word clearly and
distinctly He had attacks at times of a sort of fury and then he
became terrible he would stand in the corner with his face to the
wall and all perspiring and redred all down his bald head and down
his neckhe used to go off into vicious chuckles and stamping with
his feet order some onehis brothers probablyto be punished Beat
em he growled hoarsely coughing and choking with laughter flog
em dont spare em beat beat beat the monsters my oppressors
Thats it Thats it On the day before his death he greatly alarmed
and astonished Alexey Sergeitch He came pale and subdued into his
room and making him a low obeisance first thanked him for his care
and kindness and then asked him to send for a priest for death had
come to himhe had seen death and he must forgive every one and purify
his soul How did you see death muttered Alexey Sergeitch in
bewilderment at hearing connected speech from him for the first time
In what shape with a scythe No answered Prince L a simple old
woman in a jacket but with only one eye in her forehead and that eye
without an eyelid And the next day Prince L actually did die duly
performing everything and taking leave of every one in a rational and
affecting manner Thats just how I shall die Alexey Sergeitch would
sometimes observe And as a fact something of the same sort did happen
with himbut of that later

But now let us go back to our story Of the neighbours as I have stated
already Alexey Sergeitch saw little and they did not care much for
him called him a queer fish stuck up and a scoffer and even a
martiniste who recognised no authorities though they had no clear
idea of the meaning of this term To a certain extent the neighbours
were right Alexey Sergeitch had lived in his Suhodol for almost seventy
years on end and had had hardly anything whatever to do with the
existing authorities with the police or the lawcourts Policecourts
are for the robber and discipline for the soldier he used to say
but I thank God am neither robber nor soldier Rather queer Alexey
Sergeitch certainly was but the soul within him was by no means a petty
one I will tell you something about him

To tell the truth I never knew what were his political opinions if an
expression so modern can be used in reference to him but in his own
way he was an aristocratmore an aristocrat than a typical Russian
country gentleman More than once he expressed his regret that God had
not given him a son and heir for the honour of our name to keep up
the family In his own room there hung on the wall the familytree of
the Teliegins with many branches and a multitude of little circles
like apples in a golden frame We Teliegins he used to say are an
ancient line from long long ago however many thereve been of us
Teliegins we have never hung about great mens anterooms weve never
bent our backs or stood about in waiting nor picked up a living in the
courts nor run after decorations weve never gone trailing off to
Moscow nor intriguing in Petersburg weve sat at home each in his
hole his own man on his own land  homekeeping birds sirI
myself though I did serve in the Guardsbut not for long thank you
Alexey Sergeitch preferred the old days There was more freedom in
those days more decorum on my honour I assure you but since the year
eighteen hundred why from that year precisely he did not explain
militarism the soldiery have got the upper hand Our soldier
gentlemen stuck some sort of turbans of cocks feathers on their heads
then and turned like cocks themselves began binding their necks up as
stiff as could be  they croak and roll their eyeshow could they
help it indeed The other day a police corporal came to me Ive come
to you says he honourable sir  fancy his thinking to surprise
me with that  I know Im honourable without his telling me I have
business with you And I said to him My good sir youd better first
unfasten the hooks on your collar Or else God have mercy on usyoull
sneeze Ah what would happen to you what would happen to you Youd
break off like a mushroom  and I should have to answer for it And
they do drink these military gentlemenoh oh oh I generally order
homemade champagne to be given them because to them good wine or
poor its all the same it runs so smoothly so quickly down their
throatshow can they distinguish it And another thing theyve
started sucking at a papbottle smoking a tobaccopipe Your military
gentleman thrusts his papbottle under his moustaches between his lips
and puffs the smoke out of his nose his mouth and even his earsand
fancies himself a hero There are my sonsinlawthough one of thems a
senator and the other some sort of an administrator over therethey
suck the papbottle and they reckon themselves clever fellows too

Alexey Sergeitch could not endure smoking and moreover he could not
endure dogs especially little dogs If youre a Frenchman to be sure
you may well keep a lapdog you run and you skip about here and there
and it runs after you with its tail up  but whats the use of it to
people like us He was exceedingly neat and particular Of the Empress
Catherine he never spoke but with enthusiasm and in exalted rather
bookish phraseology Half divine she was not human Only look little
sir at that smile he would add pointing reverentially to Lampis
portrait and you will agree half divine I was so fortunate in my
life as to be deemed worthy to behold that smile close and never will
it be effaced from my heart And thereupon he would relate anecdotes of
the life of Catherine such as I have never happened to read or hear
elsewhere Here is one of them Alexey Sergeitch did not permit the
slightest allusion to the weaknesses of the great Tsaritsa And
besides he exclaimed can one judge of her as of other people

One day while she was sitting in her peignoir during her morning
toilette she commanded her hair to be combed And what do you
think The ladyinwaiting passed the comb through and sparks of
electricity simply showered out Then she summoned to her presence the
court physician Rogerson who happened to be in waiting at the court
and said to him I am I know censured for certain actions but do
you see this electricity Consequently as such is my nature and
constitution you can judge for yourself as you are a doctor that it
is unjust for them to censure me and they ought to comprehend me The
following incident remained indelible in Alexey Sergeitchs memory He
was standing one day on guard indoors in the palacehe was only
sixteen at the timeand behold the empress comes walking past him he
salutes  and she Alexey Sergeitch would exclaim at this point
with much feeling smiling at my youth and my zeal deigned to give me
her hand to kiss and patted my cheek and asked me who I was where I
came from of what family and then  here the old mans voice
usually broke  then she bade me greet my mother in her name and
thank her for having brought up her children so well And whether I was
on earth or in heaven and how and where she deigned to vanish whether
she floated away into the heights or went her way into the other
apartments  to this day I do not know

More than once I tried to question Alexey Sergeitch about those faraway
times about the people who made up the empresss circle But for the
most part he edged off the subject Whats the use of talking about old
times he used to say  its only making ones self miserable
remembering that then one was a fine young fellow and now one hasnt a
tooth left in ones head And what is there to say They were good old
times  but there enough of them And as for those folksyou were
asking you troublesome boy about the lucky oneshavent you seen how
a bubble comes up on the water As long as it lasts and is whole what
colours play upon it Red and blue and yellowa perfect rainbow or
diamond youd say it was Only it soon bursts and theres no trace of
it left And so it was with those folks

But how about Potiomkin I once inquired

Alexey Sergeitch looked grave Potiomkin Grigory Alexandrovitch was a
statesman a theologian a pupil of Catherines her cherished creation
one must say But enough of that little sir

Alexey Sergeitch was a very devout man and though it was a great
effort he attended church regularly Superstition was not noticeable in
him he laughed at omens the evil eye and such nonsense but he did
not like a hare to run across his path and to meet a priest was not
altogether agreeable to him For all that he was very respectful to
clerical persons and went up to receive their blessing and even kissed
the priests hand every time but he was not willing to enter into
conversation with them Such an extremely strong odour comes from
them he explained and I poor sinner am fastidious beyond reason
theyve such long hair and all oily and they comb it out on all
sidesthey think they show me respect by so doing and they clear their
throats so loudly when they talkfrom shyness may be or I dare say
they want to show respect in that way too And besides they make one
think of ones last hour And I dont know how it is but I still want
to go on living Only my little sir dont you repeat my words we must
respect the clergyits only fools that dont respect them and Im to
blame to babble nonsense in my old age

Alexey Sergeitch like most of the noblemen of his day had received a
very slight education but he had to some extent made good the
deficiency himself by reading He read none but Russian books of the end
of last century the more modern authors he thought insipid and
deficient in style While he read he had placed at his side on a
round onelegged table a silver tankard of frothing spiced kvas of a
special sort which sent an agreeable fragrance all over the house He
used to put on the end of his nose a pair of big round spectacles but
in latter years he did not so much read as gaze dreamily over the rims
of his spectacles lifting his eyebrows chewing his lips and sighing
Once I caught him weeping with a book on his knees greatly I own to
my surprise

He had recalled these lines

  O pitiful race of man
  Peace is unknown to thee
  Thou canst not find it save
  In the dust of the grave
  Bitter bitter is that sleep
  Rest rest in death  but living weep

These lines were the composition of a certain GormitchGormitsky a
wandering poet to whom Alexey Sergeitch had given a home in his house
as he struck him as a man of delicate feeling and even of subtlety he
wore slippers adorned with ribbons spoke with a broad accent and
frequently sighed turning his eyes to heaven in addition to all these
qualifications GormitchGormitsky spoke French decently having been
educated in a Jesuit college while Alexey Sergeitch only followed
conversation But having once got terribly drunk at the tavern that
same subtle Gormitsky showed a turbulence beyond all bounds he gave a
fearful thrashing to Alexey Sergeitchs valet the man cook two
laundrymaids who chanced to get in his way and a carpenter from
another village and he broke several panes in the windows screaming
furiously all the while There Ill show them these Russian loafers
roughhewn billygoats

And the strength the fraillooking creature put forth It was hard work
for eight men to master him For this violent proceeding Alexey
Sergeitch ordered the poet to be turned out of the house after being
put as a preliminary measure in the snowit was wintertimeto
sober him

Yes Alexey Sergeitch used to say my day is over I was a spirited
steed but Ive run my last race now Then I used to keep poets at my
expense and I used to buy pictures and books of the Jews geese of the
best breeds and pouterpigeons of pure blood I used to go in for
everything Though dogs I never did care for keeping because it goes
with drinking foulness and buffoonery I was a young man of spirit
not to be outdone That there should be anything of Teliegins and not
firstrate  why it was not to be thought of And I had a splendid
stud of horses And my horses camefrom what stock do you think young
sir Why from none other than the celebrated stables of the Tsar Ivan
Alexeitch brother of Peter the Great  its the truth Im telling
you All fawncoloured stallions sleektheir manes to their knees
their tails to their hoofs Lions And all that wasand is buried in
the past Vanity of vanitiesand every kind of vanity But stillwhy
regret it Every man has his limits set him Theres no flying above the
sky no living in the water no getting away from the earth Well
live a bit longer anyway

And the old man would smile again and sniff his Spanish snuff

The peasants liked him he was in their words a kind master not
easily angered Only they too repeated that he was a wornout steed
In former days Alexey Sergeitch used to go into everything himselfhe
used to drive out to the fields and to the mill and to the dairy and
peep into the granaries and the peasants huts every one knew his
racing droshky upholstered in crimson plush and drawn by a tall mare
with a broad white star all over her forehead called Beacon of the
same famous breed Alexey Sergeitch used to drive her himself the ends
of the reins crushed up in his fists But when his seventieth year came
the old man let everything go and handed over the management of the
estate to the bailiff Antip of whom he was secretly afraid and whom he
called Micromegas a reminiscence of Voltaire or simply plunderer
Well plunderer what have you to say Have you stacked a great deal in
the barn he would ask with a smile looking straight into the
plunderers eyes All by your good favour please your honour Antip
would respond cheerfully Favours all very well only you mind what I
say Micromegas dont you dare touch the peasants my subjects out of
my sight If they come to complain  Ive a cane you see not far
off Your cane your honour Alexey Sergeitch I always keep well in
mind Antip Micromegas would respond stroking his beard All right
dont forget it And the master and the bailiff would laugh in each
others faces With the servants and with the serfs in general his
subjects Alexey Sergeitch liked that word he was gentle in his
behaviour Because think a little nephew nothing of their own but
the cross on their neckand that copperand darent hanker after other
peoples goods  how can one expect sense of them It is needless to
state that of the socalled serf question no one even dreamed in those
days it could not disturb the peace of mind of Alexey Sergeitch he was
quite happy in the possession of his subjects but he was severe in
his censure of bad masters and used to call them the enemies of their
order He divided the nobles generally into three classes the prudent
of whom there are too few the prodigal of whom there are quite
enough and the senseless of whom there are shoals and shoals

And if any one of them is harsh and oppressive with his subjectshe
would saythen he sins against God and is guilty before men

Yes the houseserfs had an easy life of it with the old man the
subjects out of sight no doubt fared worse in spite of the cane with
which he threatened Micromegas And what a lot there were of them those
houseserfs in his house And for the most part sinewy hairy
grumbling old fellows with stooping shoulders in longskirted nankeen
coats belted round the waist with a strong sour smell always clinging
to them And on the womens side one could hear nothing but the patter
of bare feet the swish of petticoats The chief valet was called
Irinarh and Alexey Sergeitch always called him in a longdrawnout
call Irinaaarh The others he called Boy Lad Whoevers there
of the men Bells he could not endure Its not an eatinghouse God
forbid And what used to surprise me was that whatever time Alexey
Sergeitch called his valet he always promptly made his appearance as
though he had sprung out of the earth and with a scrape of his heels
his hands behind his back would stand before his master a surly as it
were angry but devoted servant

Alexey Sergeitch was liberal beyond his means but he did not like to be
called benefactor Benefactor to you indeed sir  Im doing
myself a benefit and not you sir when he was angry or indignant he
always addressed people with greater formality Give to a beggar
once he used to say and give him twice and three times Andif
he should come a fourth time give to him stillonly then you might say
too Its time my good man you found work for something else not
only for your mouth But uncle one asked sometimes suppose even
after that the beggar came again a fifth time Oh well give again
the fifth time He used to have the sick who came to him for aid
treated at his expense though he had no faith in doctors himself and
never sent for them My mother he declared used to cure illnesses
of all sorts with oil and saltshe gave it internally and rubbed it on
tooit always answered splendidly And who was my mother She was born
in the days of Peter the Greatonly fancy that

Alexey Sergeitch was a Russian in everything he liked none but Russian
dishes he was fond of Russian songs but the harmonicaa
manufactured contrivancehe hated he liked looking at the
serfgirls dances and the peasantwomens jigs in his youth I was
told he had been an enthusiastic singer and a dashing dancer he liked
steaming himself in the bath and steamed himself so vigorously that
Irinarh who serving him as bathman used to beat him with a bundle of
birchtwigs steeped in beer to rub him with a handful of tow and then
with a woollen cloththe truly devoted Irinarh used to say every time
as he crept off his shelf red as a new copper image Well this time
I the servant of God Irinarh Tolobiev have come out alive How will
it be next time

And Alexey Sergeitch spoke excellent Russian a little oldfashioned
but choice and pure as spring water continually interspersing his
remarks with favourite expressions Pon my honour please God
howsoever that may be sir and young sir

But enough of him Let us talk a little about Alexey Sergeitchs wife
Malania Pavlovna Malania Pavlovna was born at Moscow

She had been famous as the greatest beauty in Moscowla Vnus de
Moscou I knew her as a thin old woman with delicate but insignificant
features with crooked teeth like a hares in a tiny little mouth
with a multitude of finely crimped little yellow curls on her forehead
and painted eyebrows She invariably wore a pyramidal cap with pink
ribbons a high ruff round her neck a short white dress and prunella
slippers with red heels and over her dress she wore a jacket of blue
satin with a sleeve hanging loose from her right shoulder This was
precisely the costume in which she was arrayed on St Peters Day in the
year  On that day she went being still a girl with her relations
to the Hodinskoe field to see the famous boxingmatch arranged by Orlov
And Count Alexey Grigorievitch oh how often I used to hear this
story noticing me approached bowed very low taking his hat in both
hands and said Peerless beauty said he why have you hung that
sleeve from your shoulder Do you too wish to try a tussle with me 
By all means only I will tell you beforehand you have vanquished meI
give in And I am your captive And every one was looking at us and
wondering And that very costume she had worn continually ever since
Only I didnt wear a cap but a hat  la bergre de Trianon and
though I was powdered yet my hair shone through it positively shone
through it like gold Malania Pavlovna was foolish to the point of
holy innocence as it is called she chattered quite at random as
though she were hardly aware herself of what dropped from her lipsand
mostly about Orlov Orlov had become one might say the principal
interest of her life She usually walked  or rather swam into the
room with a rhythmic movement of the head like a peacock stood still
in the middle with one foot strangely turned out and two fingers
holding the tip of the loose sleeve I suppose this pose too must once
have charmed Orlov she would glance about her with haughty
nonchalance as befits a beautyand with a positive sniff and a murmur
of What next as though some importunate gallant were besieging her
with compliments she would go out again tapping her heels and
shrugging her shoulders She used too to take Spanish snuff out of a
tiny bonbonnire picking it up with a tiny golden spoon and from time
to time especially when any one unknown to her was present she would
hold upnot to her eyes she had splendid sight but to her nosea
double eyeglass in the shape of a halfmoon with a coquettish turn of
her little white hand one finger held out separate from the rest How
often has Malania Pavlovna described to me her wedding in the church of
the Ascension in Arbatysuch a fine churchand how all Moscow was
there  and the crush there wasawful Carriages with teams golden
coaches outriders  one outrider of Count Zavadovsky got run over
and we were married by the archbishop himselfand what a sermon he gave
us every one was cryingwherever I looked I saw tears  and the
governorgenerals horses were tawny like tigers And the flowers the
flowers that were brought  Simply loads of flowers And how on that
day a foreigner a wealthy tremendously wealthy person had shot
himself from loveand how Orlov too had been there And going up to
Alexey Sergeitch he had congratulated him and called him a lucky
man A lucky man you are you silly fellow said he And how in
answer to these words Alexey Sergeitch had made a wonderful bow and had
swept the floor from left to right with the plumes of his hat as if he
would say Your Excellency there is a line now between you and my
spouse which you will not overstep And Orlov Alexey Grigorievitch
understood at once and commended him Oh that was a man such a man
And how One day Alexis and I were at his house at a ballI was
married thenand he had the most marvellous diamond buttons And I
could not resist it I admired them What marvellous diamonds you have
Count said I And he taking up a knife from the table at once cut
off a button and presented it to me and said In your eyes my charmer
the diamonds are a hundred times brighter stand before the
lookingglass and compare them And I stood so and he stood beside me
Well whos right said he while he simply rolled his eyes looking
me up and down And Alexey Sergeitch was very much put out about it but
I said to him Alexis said I please dont you be put out you ought
to know me better And he answered me Dont disturb yourself
Melanie And these very diamonds are now round my medallion of Alexey
Grigorievitchyouve seen it I dare say my dearI wear it on
feastdays on a St George ribbon because he was a brave hero a
knight of St George he burned the Turks

For all that Malania Pavlovna was a very kindhearted woman she was
easily pleased Shes not one to snarl nor to sneer the maids used
to say of her Malania Pavlovna was passionately fond of sweet
thingsand a special old woman who looked after nothing but the jam
and so was called the jammaid would bring her ten times a day a
china dish with roseleaves crystallised in sugar or barberries in
honey or sherbet of bananas Malania Pavlovna was afraid of
solitudedreadful thoughts are apt to come over one she would sayand was
almost always surrounded by companions whom she would urgently implore
Talk talk why do you sit like that simply keeping your seats warm
and they would begin twittering like canaries She was no less devout
than Alexey Sergeitch and was very fond of praying but as in her own
words she had never learned to repeat prayers well she kept for the
purpose a poor deacons widow who prayed with such relish Never
stumbled over a word in her life And this deacons widow certainly
could utter the words of prayer in a sort of unbroken flow not
interrupting the stream to breathe out or draw breath in while Malania
Pavlovna listened and was much moved She had another widow in
attendance on herit was her duty to tell her stories in the night
But only the old ones Malania Pavlovna would begthose I know
already the new ones are all so farfetched Malania Pavlovna was
flighty in the extreme and at times she was fanciful too some
ridiculous notion would suddenly come into her head She did not like
the dwarf Janus for instance she was always fancying he would
suddenly get up and shout Dont you know who I am The prince of the
Buriats Mind you are to obey me Or else that he would set fire to
the house in a fit of spleen Malania Pavlovna was as liberal as Alexey
Sergeitch but she never gave moneyshe did not like to soil her
handsbut kerchiefs bracelets dresses ribbons or she would send
pies from the table or a piece of roast meat or a bottle of wine She
liked feasting the peasantwomen too on holidays they would dance
and she would tap with her heels and throw herself into attitudes

Alexey Sergeitch was well aware that his wife was a fool but almost
from the first year of his marriage he had schooled himself to keep up
the fiction that she was very witty and fond of saying cutting things
Sometimes when her chatter began to get beyond all bounds he would
threaten her with his finger and say as he did so Ah the tongue the
tongue what it will have to answer for in the other world It will be
pierced with a redhot pin

Malania Pavlovna was not offended however at this on the contrary
she seemed to feel flattered at hearing a reproof of that sort as
though she would say Well is it my fault if Im naturally witty

Malania Pavlovna adored her husband and had been all her life an
exemplarily faithful wife but there had been a romance even in her
lifea young cousin an hussar killed as she supposed in a duel on
her account but according to more trustworthy reports killed by a
blow on the head from a billiardcue in a tavern brawl A watercolour
portrait of this object of her affections was kept by her in a secret
drawer Malania Pavlovna always blushed up to her ears when she
mentioned Kapitonsuch was the name of the young heroand Alexey
Sergeitch would designedly scowl shake his finger at his wife again
and say No trusting a horse in the field nor a woman in the house
Dont talk to me of Kapiton hes Cupidon Then Malania Pavlovna would
be all of a flutter and say Alexis Alexis its too bad of you In
your young days you flirted Ive no doubt with all sorts of misses and
madamsand so now you imagine Come thats enough thats enough
my dear Malania Alexey Sergeitch interrupted with a smile Your gown
is whitebut whiter still your soul Yes Alexis it is whiter Ah
what a tongue what a tongue Alexis would repeat patting her hand

To speak of views in the case of Malania Pavlovna would be even more
inappropriate than in the case of Alexey Sergeitch yet I once chanced
to witness a strange manifestation of my aunts secret feelings In the
course of conversation I once somehow mentioned the famous chief of
police Sheshkovsky Malania Pavlovna turned suddenly lividpositively
livid green in spite of her rouge and paintand in a thick and
perfectly unaffected voice a very rare thing with hershe usually
minced a little intoned and lisped she said Oh what a name to
utter And towards nightfall too Dont utter that name I was
astonished what kind of significance could his name have for such a
harmless and inoffensive creature incapablenot merely of doingeven
of thinking of anything not permissible Anything but cheerful
reflections were aroused in me by this terror manifesting itself after
almost half a century

Alexey Sergeitch died in his eightyeighth yearin the year  which
apparently disturbed even him His death too was rather strange He
had felt well the same morning though by that time he never left his
easychair And all of a sudden he called his wife Malania my dear
come here What is it Alexis Its time for me to die my dear
thats what it is Mercy on you Alexey Sergeitch What for
Because first of all one must know when to take leave and besides
I was looking the other day at my feet Look at my feet  they
are not mine  say what you like  look at my hands look at my
stomach  that stomachs not mineso really Im using up another mans
life Send for the priest and meanwhile put me to bedfrom which I
shall not get up again Malania Pavlovna was terribly upset however she
put the old man to bed and sent for the priest Alexey Sergeitch confessed
took the sacrament said goodbye to his household and fell asleep
Malania Pavlovna was sitting by his bedside Alexis she cried
suddenly dont frighten me dont shut your eyes Are you in pain
The old man looked at his wife No no pain  but its difficult 
difficult to breathe Then after a brief silence Malania he said
so life has slipped byand do you remember when we were married 
what a couple we were Yes we were my handsome charming Alexis
The old man was silent again Malania my dear shall we meet again in
the next world I will pray God for it Alexis and the old woman
burst into tears Come dont cry silly maybe the Lord God will make
us young again thenand again we shall be a fine pair He will make
us young Alexis With the Lord all things are possible observed
Alexey Sergeitch He worketh great marvelsmaybe He will make you
sensible There my love I was joking come let me kiss your hand
And I yours And the two old people kissed each others hands
simultaneously

Alexey Sergeitch began to grow quieter and to sink into forgetfulness
Malania Pavlovna watched him tenderly brushing the tears off her
eyelashes with her fingertips For two hours she continued sitting
there Is he asleep the old woman with the talent for praying
inquired in a whisper peeping in behind Irinarh who immovable as a
post stood in the doorway gazing intently at his expiring master He
is asleep answered Malania Pavlovna also in a whisper And suddenly
Alexey Sergeitch opened his eyes My faithful companion he faltered
my honoured wife I would bow down at your little feet for all your
love and faithfulnessbut how to get up Let me sign you with the
cross Malania Pavlovna moved closer bent down But the hand he had
raised fell back powerless on the quilt and a few moments later Alexey
Sergeitch was no more

His daughters arrived only on the day of the funeral with their
husbands they had no children either of them Alexey Sergeitch showed
them no animosity in his will though he never even mentioned them on
his deathbed My heart has grown hard to them he once said to me
Knowing his kindly nature I was surprised at his words It is hard to
judge between parents and children A great ravine starts from a little
rift Alexey Sergeitch said to me once in this connection a wound a
yard wide may heal but once cut off even a finger nail it will not
grow again

I fancy the daughters were ashamed of their eccentric old parents

A month later and Malania Pavlovna too passed away From the very day of
Alexey Sergeitchs death she had hardly risen from her bed and had not
put on her usual attire but they buried her in the blue jacket and
with Orlovs medallion on her shoulder only without the diamonds Those
her daughters divided on the pretext that the diamonds should be used
in the setting of some holy pictures in reality they used them to
adorn their own persons

And so I can see my old friends as though they were alive and before my
eyes and pleasant is the memory I preserve of them And yet on my very
last visit to them I was a student by then an incident occurred which
jarred upon the impression of patriarchal harmony always produced in me
by the Teliegin household

Among the houseserfs there was one Ivan called Suhys Ivan a
coachman or coachboy as they called him on account of his small size
in spite of his being no longer young He was a tiny little man brisk
snubnosed curlyheaded with an everlastingly smiling childish face
and little eyes like a mouses He was a great joker a most comic
fellow he was great at all sorts of trickshe used to fly kites let
off fireworks and rockets to play all sorts of games gallop standing
up on the horses back fly higher than all the rest in the swing and
could even make Chinese shadows No one could amuse children better and
he would gladly spend the whole day looking after them When he started
laughing the whole house would seem to liven up they would answer
himone would say one thing one another but he always made them all
merry And even if they abused him they could not but laugh Ivan
danced marvellously especially the socalled fish dance When the
chorus struck up a dance tune the fellow would come into the middle of
the ring and then there would begin such a turning and skipping and
stamping and then he would fall flat on the ground and imitate the
movement of a fish brought out of the water on to dry land such turning
and wriggling the heels positively clapped up to the head and then he
would get up and shriekthe earth seemed simply quivering under him At
times Alexey Sergeitch who was as I have said already exceedingly
fond of watching dancing could not resist shouting Little Vania
here coachboy Dance us the fish smartly now and a minute later he
would whisper enthusiastically Ah what a fellow it is

Well on my last visit this Ivan Suhih came into my room and without
saying a word fell on his knees Ivan whats the matter Save me
sir Why what is it And thereupon Ivan told me his trouble

He was exchanged twenty years ago by the Suhy family for a serf of
the Telieginssimply exchanged without any kind of formality or
written deed the man given in exchange for him had died but the Suhys
had forgotten about Ivan and he had stayed on in Alexey Sergeitchs
house as his own serf only his nickname had served to recall his
origin But now his former masters were dead the estate had passed into
other hands and the new owner who was reported to be a cruel and
oppressive man having learned that one of his serfs was detained
without cause or reason at Alexey Sergeitchs began to demand him back
in case of refusal he threatened legal proceedings and the threat was
not an empty one as he was himself of the rank of privy councillor and
had great weight in the province Ivan had rushed in terror to Alexey
Sergeitch The old man was sorry for his dancer and he offered the
privy councillor to buy Ivan for a considerable sum But the privy
councillor would not hear of it he was a Little Russian and obstinate
as the devil The poor fellow would have to be given up I have spent
my life here and Im at home here I have served here here I have
eaten my bread and here I want to die Ivan said to meand there was
no smile on his face now on the contrary it looked turned to stone
And now I am to go to this wretch Am I a dog to be flung from one
kennel to another with a noose round my neck  to be told There
get along with you Save me master beg your uncle remember how I
always amused you Or else therell be harm come of it it wont end
without sin

What sort of sin Ivan

I shall kill that gentleman I shall simply go and say to him
Master let me go back or else mind be careful of yourself I
shall kill you

If a siskin or a chaffinch could have spoken and had begun declaring
that it would peck another bird to death it would not have reduced me
to greater amazement than did Ivan at that moment What Suhys Vania
that dancing jesting comic fellow the favourite playfellow of
children and a child himself that kindesthearted of creatures a
murderer What ridiculous nonsense Not for an instant did I believe
him what astonished me to such a degree was that he was capable of
saying such a thing Anyway I appealed to Alexey Sergeitch I did not
repeat what Ivan had said to me but began asking him whether something
couldnt be done My young sir the old man answered I should be
only too happybut whats to be done I offered this Little Russian an
immense compensationI offered him three hundred roubles pon my
honour I tell you but hetheres no moving him whats one to do The
transaction was not legal it was done on trust in the oldfashioned
way  and now see what mischiefs come of it This Little Russian
fellow you see will take Ivan by force do what we will his arm is
powerful the governor eats cabbagesoup at his table hell be sending
along soldiers And Im afraid of those soldiers In old days to be
sure I would have stood up for Ivan come what might but now look at
me what a feeble creature I have grown How can I make a fight for it
It was true on my last visit I found Alexey Sergeitch greatly aged
even the centres of his eyes had that milky colour that babies eyes
have and his lips wore not his old conscious smile but that unnatural
mawkish unconscious grin which never even in sleep leaves the faces
of very decrepit old people

I told Ivan of Alexey Sergeitchs decision He stood still was silent
for a little shook his head Well said he at last what is to be
theres no escaping Only my minds made up Theres nothing left then
but to play the fool to the end Something for drink please I gave
him something he drank himself drunk and that day danced the fish
dance so that the serfgirls and peasantwomen positively shrieked with
delighthe surpassed himself in his antics so wonderfully

Next day I went home and three months later in Petersburg I heard
that Ivan had kept his word He had been sent to his new master his
master had called him into his room and explained to him that he would
be made coachman that a team of three ponies would be put in his
charge and that he would be severely dealt with if he did not look
after them well and were not punctual in discharging his duties
generally Im not fond of joking Ivan heard the master out first
bowed down to his feet and then announced it was as his honour pleased
but he could not be his servant

Let me off for a yearly quitmoney your honour said he or send me
for a soldier or else therell be mischief come of it

The master flew into a rage Ah what a fellow you are How dare you
speak to me like that In the first place Im to be called your
excellency and not your honour and secondly youre beyond the age
and not of a size to be sent for a soldier and lastly what mischief
do you threaten me with Do you mean to set the house on fire eh

No your excellency not the house on fire

Murder me then eh

Ivan was silent Im not your servant he said at last

Oh well Ill show you roared the master whether you re my servant
or not And he had Ivan cruelly punished but yet had the three ponies
put into his charge and made him coachman in the stables

Ivan apparently submitted he began driving about as coachman As he
drove well he soon gained favour with the master especially as Ivan
was very quiet and steady in his behaviour and the ponies improved so
much in his hands he turned them out as sound and sleek as
cucumbersit was quite a sight to see The master took to driving out
with him oftener than with the other coachmen Sometimes he would ask
him I say Ivan do you remember how badly we got on when we met
Youve got over all that nonsense eh But Ivan never made any response
to such remarks So one day the master was driving with Ivan to the town
in his threehorse sledge with bells and a highback covered with carpet
The horses began to walk up the hill and Ivan got off the boxseat and
went behind the back of the sledge as though he had dropped something
It was a sharp frost the master sat wrapped up with a beaver cap
pulled down on to his ears Then Ivan took an axe from under his skirt
came up to the master from behind knocked off his cap and saying I
warned you Piotr Petrovitchyouve yourself to blame now he struck
off his head at one blow Then he stopped the ponies put the cap on his
dead master and getting on the boxseat again drove him to the town
straight to the courts of justice

Heres the Suhinsky general for you dead I have killed him As I told
him so I did to him Put me in fetters

They took Ivan tried him sentenced him to the knout and then to hard
labour The lighthearted birdlike dancer was sent to the mines and
there passed out of sight for ever

Yes one can but repeat in another sense Alexey Sergeitchs words
They were good old times  but enough of them






THE BRIGADIER




I


Reader do you know those little homesteads of country gentlefolks
which were plentiful in our Great Russian Oukrane twentyfive or thirty
years ago Now one rarely comes across them and in another ten years
the last of them will I suppose have disappeared for ever The running
pond overgrown with reeds and rushes the favourite haunt of fussy
ducks among whom one may now and then come across a wary teal beyond
the pond a garden with avenues of limetrees the chief beauty and glory
of our blackearth plains with smothered rows of Spanish
strawberries with dense thickets of gooseberries currants and
raspberries in the midst of which in the languid hour of the stagnant
noonday heat one would be sure to catch glimpses of a serfgirls
striped kerchief and to hear the shrill ring of her voice Close by
would be a summerhouse standing on four legs a conservatory a
neglected kitchen garden with flocks of sparrows hung on stakes and a
cat curled up on the tumbledown well a little further leafy
appletrees in the high grass which is green below and grey above
straggling cherrytrees peartrees on which there is never any fruit
then flowerbeds poppies peonies pansies milkwort maids in green
bushes of Tartar honeysuckle wild jasmine lilac and acacia with the
continual hum of bees and wasps among their thick fragrant sticky
branches At last comes the manorhouse a onestoried building on a
brick foundation with greenish windowpanes in narrow frames a
sloping once painted roof a little balcony from which the vases of the
balustrade are always jutting out a crooked gable and a husky old dog
in the recess under the steps at the door Behind the house a wide yard
with nettles wormwood and burdocks in the corners outbuildings with
doors that stick doves and rooks on the thatched roofs a little
storehouse with a rusty weathercock two or three birchtrees with
rooks nests in their bare top branches and beyondthe road with
cushions of soft dust in the ruts and a field and the long hurdles of
the hemp patches and the grey little huts of the village and the
cackle of geese in the faraway rich meadows Is all this familiar to
you reader In the house itself everything is a little awry a little
ricketybut no matter It stands firm and keeps warm the stoves are
like elephants the furniture is of all sorts homemade Little paths
of white footmarks run from the doors over the painted floors In the
hall siskins and larks in tiny cages in the corner of the diningroom
an immense English clock in the form of a tower with the inscription
Strikesilent in the drawingroom portraits of the family painted
in oils with an expression of illtempered alarm on the brickcoloured
faces and sometimes too an old warped picture of flowers and fruit or a
mythological subject Everywhere there is the smell of kvas of apples
of linseedoil and of leather Flies buzz and hum about the ceiling and
the windows A daring cockroach suddenly shows his countenance from
behind the lookingglass frame No matter one can live hereand
live very well too




II


Just such a homestead it was my lot to visit thirty years ago  it was
in days long past as you perceive The little estate in which this
house stood belonged to a friend of mine at the university it had only
recently come to him on the death of a bachelor cousin and he was not
living in it himself But at no great distance from it there were
wide tracts of steppe bog in which at the time of summer migration
when they are on the wing there are great numbers of snipe my friend
and I both enthusiastic sportsmen agreed therefore to go on St
Peters day he from Moscow I from my own village to his little house
My friend lingered in Moscow and was two days late I did not care to
start shooting without him I was received by an old servant Narkiz
Semyonov who had had notice of my coming This old servant was not in
the least like Savelitch or Caleb my friend used to call him in
joke Marquis There was something of conceit even of affectation
about him he looked down on us young men with a certain dignity but
cherished no particularly respectful sentiments for other landowners
either of his old master he spoke slightingly while his own class he
simply scorned for their ignorance He could read and write expressed
himself correctly and with judgment and did not drink He seldom went
to church and so was looked upon as a dissenter In appearance he was
thin and tall had a long and goodlooking face a sharp nose and
overhanging eyebrows which he was continually either knitting or
lifting he wore a neat roomy coat and boots to his knees with
heartshaped scallops at the tops




III


On the day of my arrival Narkiz having given me lunch and cleared the
table stood in the doorway looked intently at me and with some play
of the eyebrows observed

What are you going to do now sir

Well really I dont know If Nikolai Petrovitch had kept his word and
come we should have gone shooting together

So you really expected sir that he would come at the time he
promised

Of course I did

Hm Narkiz looked at me again and shook his head as it were with
commiseration If you d care to amuse yourself with reading he
continued there are some books left of my old masters Ill get them
you if you like only you wont read them I expect

Why

Theyre books of no value not written for the gentlemen of
these days

Have you read them

If I hadnt read them I wouldnt have spoken about them A dreambook
for instance  thats not much of a book is it There are others too
of course  only you wont read them either

Why

They are religious books

I was silent for a space Narkiz was silent too

What vexes me most I began is staying in the house in such
weather

Take a walk in the garden or go into the copse Weve a copse here
beyond the threshingfloor Are you fond of fishing

Are there fish here

Yes in the pond Loaches sandeels and perches are caught there
Now to be sure the best time is over Julys here But anyway you
might try Shall I get the tackle ready

Yes do please

Ill send a boy with you  to put on the worms Or maybe I d better
come myself Narkiz obviously doubted whether I knew how to set about
things properly by myself

Come please come along

Narkiz without a word grinned from ear to ear then suddenly knitted
his brows  and went out of the room




IV


Half an hour later we set off to catch fish Narkiz had put on an
extraordinary sort of cap with ears and was more dignified than ever
He walked in front with a steady even step two rods swayed regularly
up and down on his shoulders a barelegged boy followed him carrying a
can and a pot of worms

Here near the dike theres a seat put up on the floating platform on
purpose Narkiz was beginning to explain to me but he glanced ahead
and suddenly exclaimed Aha but our poor folk are here already 
they keep it up it seems

I craned my head to look from behind him and saw on the floating
platform on the very seat of which he had been speaking two persons
sitting with their backs to us they were placidly fishing

Who are they I asked

Neighbours Narkiz responded with displeasure Theyve nothing to
eat at home and so here they come to us

Are they allowed to

The old master allowed them Nikolai Petrovitch maybe wont give
them permission The long one is a superannuated deaconquite a
silly creature and as for the other thats a little stouterhes a
brigadier

A brigadier I repeated wondering This brigadiers attire was
almost worse than the deacons

I assure you hes a brigadier And he did have a fine property once
But now he has only a corner given him out of charity and he lives 
on what God sends him But by the way what are we to do Theyve taken
the best place We shall have to disturb our precious visitors

No Narkiz please dont disturb them Well sit here a little aside
they wont interfere with us I should like to make acquaintance with
the brigadier

As you like Only as far as acquaintance goes  you neednt expect
much satisfaction from it sir hes grown very weak in his head and in
conversation hes silly as a little child As well he may be hes past
his eightieth year

Whats his name

Vassily Fomitch Guskovs his surname

And the deacon

The deacon  his nicknames Cucumber Every one about here calls him
so but what his real name isGod knows A foolish creature A regular
neerdowell

Do they live together

No but therethe devil has tied them together it seems




V


We approached the platform The brigadier cast one glance upon us 
and promptly fixed his eyes on the float Cucumber jumped up pulled
back his rod took off his wornout clerical hat passed a trembling
hand over his rough yellow hair made a sweeping bow and gave vent to a
feeble little laugh His bloated face betrayed him an inveterate
drunkard his staring little eyes blinked humbly He gave his neighbour
a poke in the ribs as though to let him know that they must clear
out The brigadier began to move on the seat

Sit still I beg dont disturb yourselves I hastened to say You
wont interfere with us in the least Well take up our position here
sit still

Cucumber wrapped his ragged smock round him twitched his shoulders his
lips his beard Obviously he felt our presence oppressive and he
would have been glad to slink away  but the brigadier was again lost
in the contemplation of his float The neerdoweel coughed twice
sat down on the very edge of the seat put his hat on his knees and
tucking his bare legs up under him he discreetly dropped in his line

Any bites Narkiz inquired haughtily as in leisurely fashion he
unwound his reel

Weve caught a matter of five loaches answered Cucumber in a cracked
and husky voice and he took a goodsized perch

Yes a perch repeated the brigadier in a shrill pipe




VI


I fell to watching closelynot him but his reflection in the pond It
was as clearly reflected as in a lookingglassa little darker a
little more silvery The wide stretch of pond wafted a refreshing
coolness upon us a cool breath of air seemed to rise too from the
steep damp bank and it was the sweeter as in the dark blue flooded
with gold above the tree tops the stagnant sultry heat hung a burden
that could be felt over our heads There was no stir in the water near
the dike in the shade cast by the drooping bushes on the bank water
spiders gleamed like tiny bright buttons as they described their
everlasting circles at long intervals there was a faint ripple just
perceptible round the floats when a fish was playing with the worm
Very few fish were taken during a whole hour we drew up only two
loaches and an eel I could not say why the brigadier aroused my
curiosity his rank could not have any influence on me ruined noblemen
were not even at that time looked upon as a rarity and his appearance
presented nothing remarkable Under the warm cap which covered the
whole upper part of his head down to his ears and his eyebrows could be
seen a smooth red cleanshaven round face with a little nose little
lips and small clear grey eyes Simplicity and weakness of character
and a sort of longstanding helpless sorrow were visible in that meek
almost childish face the plump white little hands with short fingers
had something helpless incapable about them too I could not
conceive how this forlorn old man could once have been an officer could
have maintained discipline have given his commandsand that too in
the stern days of Catherine I watched him now and then he puffed out
his cheeks and uttered a feeble whistle like a little child sometimes
he screwed up his eyes painfully with effort as all decrepit people
will Once he opened his eyes wide and lifted them They stared at me
from out of the depths of the waterand strangely touching and even
full of meaning their dejected glance seemed to me




VII


I tried to begin a conversation with the brigadier  but Narkiz had
not misinformed me the poor old man certainly had become weak in his
intellect He asked me my surname and after repeating his inquiry
twice pondered and pondered and at last brought out Yes I fancy
there was a judge of that name here Cucumber wasnt there a judge
about here of that name hey To be sure there was Vassily Fomitch
your honour responded Cucumber who treated him altogether as a child
There was certainly But let me have your hook your worm must have
been eaten off Yes so it is

Did you know the Lomov family the brigadier suddenly asked me in a
cracked voice

What Lomov family is that

Why Fiodor Ivanitch Yevstigney Ivanitch Alexey Ivanitch the Jew and
Fedulia Ivanovna the plunderer  and then too 

The brigadier suddenly broke off and looked down confused

They were the people he was most intimate with Narkiz whispered
bending towards me it was through them through that same Alexey
Ivanitch that he called a Jew and through a sister of Alexey
Ivanitchs Agrafena Ivanovna as you may say that he lost all his
property

What are you saying there about Agrafena Ivanovna the brigadier
called out suddenly and his head was raised his white eyebrows were
frowning Youd better mind And why Agrafena pray Agrippina
Ivanovnathats what you should call her

Theretherethere sir Cucumber was beginning to falter

Dont you know the verses the poet Milonov wrote about her the old
man went on suddenly getting into a state of excitement which was a
complete surprise to me No hymeneal lights were kindled he began
chanting pronouncing all the vowels through his nose giving the
syllables an en the nasal sound they have in French and it was
strange to hear this connected speech from his lips No torches  No
thats not it

  Not vain Corruptions idols frail
  Not amaranth nor porphyry
  Rejoiced their hearts 
  One thing in them 

That was about us Do you hear

  One thing in them unquenchable
  Subduing sweet desirable
  To nurse their mutual flame in love

And you talk about Agrafena

Narkiz chuckled halfcontemptuously halfindifferently What a queer
fish it is he said to himself But the brigadier had again relapsed
into dejection the rod had dropped from his hands and slipped into
the water




VIII


Well to my thinking our fishing is a poor business observed
Cucumber the fish see dont bite at all Its got fearfully hot and
theres a fit of mencholy come over our gentleman Its clear we must
be going home that will be best He cautiously drew out of his pocket
a tin bottle with a wooden stopper uncorked it scattered snuff on his
wrist and sniffed it up in both nostrils at once Ah what good
snuff he moaned as he recovered himself It almost made my tooth
ache Now my dear Vassily Fomitch get upits time to be off

The brigadier got up from the bench

Do you live far from here I asked Cucumber

No our gentleman lives not far  it wont be as much as a mile

Will you allow me to accompany you I said addressing the brigadier
I felt disinclined to let him go

Narkiz was surprised at my intention but I paid no attention to the
disapproving shake of his longeared cap and walked out of the garden
with the brigadier who was supported by Cucumber The old man moved
fairly quickly with a motion as though he were on stilts




IX


We walked along a scarcely trodden path through a grassy glade between
two birch copses The sun was blazing the orioles called to each other
in the green thicket corncrakes chattered close to the path blue
butterflies fluttered in crowds about the white and red flowers of the
lowgrowing clover in the perfectly still grass bees hung as though
asleep languidly buzzing Cucumber seemed to pull himself together and
brightened up he was afraid of Narkizhe lived always under his eye I
was a strangera new comerwith me he was soon quite at home

Heres our gentleman he said in a rapid flow hes a small eater
and no mistake but only one perch is that enough for him Unless
your honour you would like to contribute something Close here round
the corner at the little inn there are firstrate white wheaten
rolls And if so please your honour this poor sinner too will
gladly drink on this occasion to your health and may it be of long
years and long days I gave him a little silver and was only just in
time to pull away my hand which he was falling upon to kiss He
learned that I was a sportsman and fell to talking of a very good
friend of his an officer who had a Mindindenger Swedish gun with a
copper stock just like a cannon so that when you fire it off you are
almost knocked senselessit had been left behind by the Frenchand a
dogsimply one of Natures marvels that he himself had always had a
great passion for the chase and his priest would have made no trouble
about ithe used in fact to catch quails with himbut the
ecclesiastical superior had pursued him with endless persecution and
as for Narkiz Semyonitch he observed in a singsong tone if
according to his notions Im not a trustworthy personwell what I say
is hes let his eyebrows grow till hes like a woodcock and he
fancies all the sciences are known to him By this time we had reached
the inn a solitary tumbledown oneroomed little hut without backyard
or outbuildings an emaciated dog lay curled up under the window a hen
was scratching in the dust under his very nose Cucumber sat the
brigadier down on the bank and darted instantly into the hut While he
was buying the rolls and emptying a glass I never took my eyes off the
brigadier who God knows why struck me as something of an enigma In
the life of this manso I musedthere must certainly have been
something out of the ordinary But he it seemed did not notice me at
all He was sitting huddled up on the bank and twisting in his fingers
some pinks which he had gathered in my friends garden Cucumber made
his appearance at last with a bundle of rolls in his hand he made
his appearance all red and perspiring with an expression of gleeful
surprise on his face as though he had just seen something exceedingly
agreeable and unexpected He at once offered the brigadier a roll to
eat and the latter at once ate it We proceeded on our way




X


On the strength of the spirits he had drunk Cucumber quite unbent as
it is called He began trying to cheer up the brigadier who was still
hurrying forward with a tottering motion as though he were on stilts
Why are you so downcast sir and hanging your head Let me sing you a
song Thatll cheer you up in a minute He turned to me Our gentleman
is very fond of a joke mercy on us yes Yesterday what did I seea
peasantwoman washing a pair of breeches on the platform and a great
fat woman she was and he stood behind her simply all of a shake with
laughteryes indeed  In a minute allow me do you know the song of
the hare You mustnt judge me by my looks theres a gypsy woman living
here in the town a perfect fright but singspon my soul ones ready
to lie down and die He opened wide his moist red lips and began
singing his head on one side his eyes shut and his beard quivering

  The hare beneath the bush lies still
  The hunters vainly scour the hill
  The hare lies hid and holds his breath
  His ears pricked up he lies there still
       Waiting for death
  O hunters what harm have I done
  To vex or injure you Although
  Among the cabbages I run
  One leaf I nibbleonly one
       And thats not yours
          Oh no

Cucumber went on with everincreasing energy

  Into the forest dark he fled
  His tail he let the hunters see
  Excuse me gentlemen says he
  That so I turn my back on you
       I am not yours

Cucumber was not singing now  he was bellowing

  The hunters hunted day and night
  And still the hare was out of sight
  So talking over his misdeeds
  They ended by disputing quite
       Alas the hare is not for us
         The squinteye is too sharp for us

The first two lines of each stanza Cucumber sang with each syllable
drawn out the other three on the contrary very briskly and
accompanied them with little hops and shuffles of his feet at the
conclusion of each verse he cut a caper in which he kicked himself with
his own heels As he shouted at the top of his voice The squinteye is
too sharp for us he turned a somersault His expectations were
fulfilled The brigadier suddenly went off into a thin tearful little
chuckle and laughed so heartily that he could not go on and stayed
still in a halfsitting posture helplessly slapping his knees with his
hands I looked at his face flushed crimson and convulsively working
and felt very sorry for him at that instant especially Encouraged by
his success Cucumber fell to capering about in a squatting position
singing the refrain of Shildibudildi and Natchikitchikaldi He
stumbled at last with his nose in the dust The brigadier suddenly
ceased laughing and hobbled on




XI


We went on another quarter of a mile A little village came into sight
on the edge of a not very deep ravine on one side stood the lodge
with a halfruined roof and a solitary chimney in one of the two rooms
of this lodge lived the brigadier The owner of the village who always
resided in Petersburg the widow of the civil councillor Lomov hadso
I learned laterbestowed this little nook upon the brigadier She had
given orders that he should receive a monthly pension and had also
assigned for his service a halfwitted serfgirl living in the same
village who though she barely understood human speech was yet
capable in the ladys opinion of sweeping a floor and cooking
cabbagesoup At the door of the lodge the brigadier again addressed me
with the same eighteenthcentury smile would I be pleased to walk into
his apartement We went into this apartement Everything in it was
exceedingly filthy and poor so filthy and so poor that the brigadier
noticing probably by the expression of my face the impression it made
on me observed shrugging his shoulders and half closing his eyelids
Ce nest pas  oeil de perdrix  What precisely he meant by this
remained a mystery to me When I addressed him in French I got no
reply from him in that language Two objects struck me especially in the
brigadiers abode a large officers cross of St George in a black
frame under glass with an inscription in an oldfashioned handwriting
Received by the Colonel of the Tchernigov regiment Vassily Guskov for
the storming of Prague in the year  and secondly a halflength
portrait in oils of a handsome blackeyed woman with a long dark face
hair turned up high and powdered with postiches on the temple and chin
in a flowered lowcut bodice with blue frills the style of  The
portrait was badly painted but was probably a good likeness there was
a wonderful look of life and will something extraordinarily living and
resolute about the face It was not looking at the spectator it was
as it were turning away and not smiling the curve of the thin nose
the regular but flat lips the almost unbroken straight line of the
thick eyebrows all showed an imperious haughty fiery temper No great
effort was needed to picture that face glowing with passion or with
rage Just below the portrait on a little pedestal stood a halfwithered
bunch of simple wild flowers in a thick glass jar The brigadier went up
to the pedestal stuck the pinks he was carrying into the jar and
turning to me and lifting his hand in the direction of the portrait he
observed Agrippina Ivanovna Teliegin by birth Lomov The words of
Narkiz came back to my mind and I looked with redoubled interest at the
expressive and evil face of the woman for whose sake the brigadier had
lost all his fortune

You took part I see sir in the storming of Prague I began
pointing to the St George cross and won a sign of distinction rare
at any time but particularly so then you must remember Suvorov

Alexander Vassilitch the brigadier answered after a brief silence
in which he seemed to be pulling his thoughts together to be sure I
remember him he was a little brisk old man Before one could stir a
finger hed be here and there and everywhere the brigadier chuckled
He rode into Warsaw on a Cossack horse he was all in diamonds and he
says to the Poles Ive no watch I forgot it in Petersburgno watch
 and they shouted and huzzaed for him Queer chaps Hey Cucumber lad
he added suddenly changing and raising his voice the deaconbuffoon
had remained standing at the door wheres the rolls eh And tell
Grunka  to bring some kvas

Directly your honour I heard Cucumbers voice reply He handed the
brigadier the bundle of rolls and going out of the lodge approached a
dishevelled creature in ragsthe halfwitted girl Grunka I
supposeand as far as I could make out through the dusty little window
proceeded to demand kvas from herat least he several times raised one
hand like a funnel to his mouth and waved the other in our direction




XII


I made another attempt to get into conversation with the brigadier
but he was evidently tired he sank sighing and groaning on the
little couch and moaning Oy oy my poor bones my poor bones
untied his garters I remember I wondered at the time how a man came
to be wearing garters I did not realise that in former days every one
wore them The brigadier began yawning with prolonged unconcealed
yawns not taking his drowsy eyes off me all the time so very little
children yawn The poor old man did not even seem quite to understand
my question And he had taken Prague He sword in hand in the
smoke and the dustat the head of Suvorovs soldiers the
bulletpierced flag waving above him the hideous corpses under his
feet He  he Wasnt it wonderful But yet I could not help
fancying that there had been events more extraordinary in the
brigadiers life Cucumber brought white kvas in an iron jug the
brigadier drank greedilyhis hands shook Cucumber supported the
bottom of the jug The old man carefully wiped his toothless mouth
with both handsand again staring at me fell to chewing and munching
his lips I saw how it was bowed and went out of the room

Now hell have a nap observed Cucumber coming out behind me Hes
terribly knocked up todayhe went to the grave early this morning

To whose grave

To Agrafena Ivanovnas to pay his devotions She is buried in our
parish cemetery here itll be four miles from here Vassily Fomitch
visits it every week without fail Indeed it was he who buried her and
put the fence up at his own expense

Has she been dead long

Well lets thinktwenty years about

Was she a friend of his or what

Her whole life you may say she passed with him  really I
myself I must own never knew the lady but they do say  what
there was between them  well well well Sir the deacon added
hurriedly seeing I had turned away wouldnt you like to give me
something for another drop for its time I was home in my hut and
rolled up in my blanket

I thought it useless to question Cucumber further so gave him a few
coppers and set off homewards




XIII


At home I betook myself for further information to Narkiz He as I
might have anticipated was somewhat unapproachable stood a little on
his dignity expressed his surprise that such paltry matters could
interest me and finally told me what he knew I heard the
following details

Vassily Fomitch Guskov had become acquainted with Agrafena Ivanovna
Teliegin at Moscow soon after the suppression of the Polish
insurrection her husband had had a post under the governorgeneral and
Vassily Fomitch was on furlough He fell in love with her there and
then but did not leave the army at once he was a man of forty with no
family with a fortune Her husband soon after died She was left
without children poor and in debt Vassily Fomitch heard of her
position threw up the service he received the rank of brigadier on his
retirement and sought out his charming widow who was not more than
fiveandtwenty paid all her debts redeemed her estate From that
time he had never parted from her and finished by living altogether in
her house She too seems to have cared for him but would not marry
him She was froward the deceased lady was Narkizs comment on this
My liberty she would say is dearer to me than anything But as for
making use of himshe made use of him in every possible way and
whatever money he had he dragged to her like an ant But the
frowardness of Agrafena Ivanovna at times assumed extreme proportions
she was not of a mild temper and somewhat too ready with her hands
Once she pushed her pageboy down the stairs and he went and broke two
of his ribs and one leg Agrafena Ivanovna was frightened  she
promptly ordered the page to be shut up in the lumberroom and she did
not leave the house nor give up the key of the room to any one till the
moans within had ceased The page was secretly buried And had it
been in the Empress Catherines time Narkiz added in a whisper
bending down maybe the affair would have ended theremany such deeds
were hidden under a bushel in those days but as  here Narkiz drew
himself up and raised his voice as our righteous Tsar Alexander the
Blessed was reigning then  well a fuss was made A trial
followed the body was dug up  signs of violence were found on it 
and a great todo there was And what do you think Vassily Fomitch took
it all on himself I said he am responsible for it all it was I
pushed him down and I too shut him up Well of course all the judges
then and the lawyers and the police  fell on him directly  fell
on him and never let him go  I can assure you  till the last
farthing was out of his purse Theyd leave him in peace for a while
and then attack him again Down to the very time when the French came
into Russia they were worrying at him and only dropped him then Well
he managed to provide for Agrafena Ivanovnato be sure he saved
herthat one must say Well and afterwards up to her death indeed
he lived with her and they do say she led him a pretty dancethe
brigadier that is sent him on foot from Moscow into the countryby
God she didto get her rents in I suppose It was on her account on
account of this same Agrafena Ivanovnahe fought a duel with the
English milord Hugh Hughes and the English milord was forced to make a
formal apology too But later on the brigadier went down hill more and
more Well and now he cant be reckoned a man at all

Who was that Alexey Ivanitch the Jew I asked through whom he was
brought to ruin

Oh the brother of Agrafena Ivanovna A grasping creature Jewish
indeed He lent his sister money at interest and Vassily Fomitch was
her security He had to pay for it too  pretty heavily

And Fedulia Ivanovna the plundererwho was she

Her sister too  and a sharp one too as sharp as a lance A
terrible woman




XIV


What a place to find a Werter I thought next day as I set off again
towards the brigadiers dwelling I was at that time very young and
that was possibly why I thought it my duty not to believe in the lasting
nature of love Still I was impressed and somewhat puzzled by the story
I had heard and felt an intense desire to stir up the old man to make
him talk freely Ill first refer to Suvorov again so I resolved
within myself there must be some spark of his former fire hidden
within him still  and then when hes warmed up Ill turn the
conversation on that  whats her name  Agrafena Ivanovna A queer
name for a CharlotteAgrafena

I found my WerterGuskov in the middle of a tiny kitchengarden a few
steps from the lodge near the old framework of a neverfinished hut
overgrown with nettles On the mildewed upper beams of this skeleton hut
some miserablelooking turkey poults were scrambling incessantly
slipping and flapping their wings and cackling There was some poor sort
of green stuff growing in two or three borders The brigadier had just
pulled a young carrot out of the ground and rubbing it under his arm
to clean it proceeded to chew its thin tail I bowed to him and
inquired after his health

He obviously did not recognise me though he returned my greetingthat
is to say touched his cap with his hand though without leaving off
munching the carrot

You didnt go fishing today I began in the hope of recalling myself
to his memory by this question

Today he repeated and pondered  while the carrot stuck into his
mouth grew shorter and shorter Why I suppose its Cucumber
fishing  But Im allowed to too

Of course of course most honoured Vassily Fomitch I didnt mean
that But arent you hot  like this in the sun

The brigadier was wearing a thick wadded dressinggown

Eh Hot he repeated again as though puzzled over the question and
having finally swallowed the carrot he gazed absently upwards

Would you care to step into my apartement he said suddenly The
poor old man had it seemed only this phrase still left him always at
his disposal

We went out of the kitchengarden  but there involuntarily I stopped
short Between us and the lodge stood a huge bull With his head down to
the ground and a malignant gleam in his eyes he was snorting heavily
and furiously and with a rapid movement of one foreleg he tossed the
dust up in the air with his broad cleft hoof lashed his sides with his
tail and suddenly backing a little shook his shaggy neck stubbornly
and bellowednot loud but plaintively and at the same time
menacingly I was I confess alarmed but Vassily Fomitch stepped
forward with perfect composure and saying in a stern voice Now then
country bumpkin shook his handkerchief at him The bull backed again
bowed his horns  suddenly rushed to one side and ran away wagging
his head from side to side

Theres no doubt he took Prague I thought

We went into the room The brigadier pulled his cap off his hair which
was soaked with perspiration ejaculated Fa  squatted down on the
edge of a chair  bowed his head gloomily

I have come to you Vassily Fomitch I began my diplomatic approaches
because as you have served under the leadership of the great
Suvorovhave taken part altogether in such important eventsit would
be very interesting for me to hear some particulars of your past

The brigadier stared at me His face kindled strangelyI began to
expect if not a story at least some word of approval of sympathy

But I sir must be going to die soon he said in an undertone

I was utterly nonplussed

Why Vassily Fomitch I brought out at last what makes you 
suppose that

The brigadier suddenly flung his arms violently up and down

Because sir  I as maybe you know  often in my dreams see
Agrippina IvanovnaHeavens peace be with herand never can I catch
her I am always running after herbut cannot catch her But last
nightI dreamedshe was standing as it were before me halfturned
away and laughing I ran up to her at once and caught her  and she
seemed to turn round quite and said to me Well Vassinka now you
have caught me

What do you conclude from that Vassily Fomitch

Why sir I conclude it has come that we shall be together And glory
to God for it I tell you glory be to God Almighty the Father the
Son and the Holy Ghost the brigadier fell into a chant as it was in
the beginning is now and ever shall be Amen

The brigadier began crossing himself I could get nothing more out of
him so I went away




XV


The next day my friend arrived I mentioned the brigadier and my
visits to him

Oh yes of course I know his story answered my friend I know
Madame Lomov very well the privy councillors widow by whose favour he
obtained a home here Oh wait a minute I believe there must be
preserved here his letter to the privy councillors widow it was on the
strength of that letter that she assigned him his little cot My friend
rummaged among his papers and actually found the brigadiers letter
Here it is word for word with the omission of the mistakes in spelling
The brigadier like every one of his epoch was a little hazy in that
respect But to preserve these errors seemed unnecessary his letter
bears the stamp of his age without them

HONOURED MADAM RASSA PAVLOVNAOn the decease of my friend and your
aunt I had the happiness of addressing to you two letters the first on
the first of June the second on the sixth of July of the year 
while she expired on the sixth of May in that year in them I discovered
to you the feelings of my soul and of my heart which were crushed under
deadly wrongs and they reflected in full my bitter despair in truth
deserving of commiseration both letters were despatched by the imperial
mail registered and hence I cannot conceive that they have not been
perused by your eye By the genuine candour of my letters I had counted
upon winning your benevolent attention but the compassionate feelings
of your heart were far removed from me in my woe Left on the loss of my
one only friend Agrippina Ivanovna in the most distressed and
povertystricken circumstances I rested by her instructions all my
hopes on your bounty she aware of her end approaching said to me in
these words as it were from the grave and never can I forget them My
friend I have been your serpent and am guilty of all your unhappiness
I feel how much you have sacrificed for me and in return I leave you in
a disastrous and truly destitute situation on my death have recourse to
Rassa Pavlovnathat is to youand implore her aid invite her
succour She has a feeling heart and I have confidence in her that she
will not leave you forlorn Honoured madam let me call to witness the
allhigh Creator of the world that those were her words and I am
speaking with her tongue and therefore trusting firmly in your
goodness to you first of all I addressed myself with my openhearted
and candid letters but after protracted expectation receiving no reply
to them I could not conceive otherwise than that your benevolent heart
had left me without attention Such your unfavourable disposition
towards me reduced me to the depths of despairwhither and to whom
was I to turn in my misfortune I knew not my soul was troubled my
intellect went astray at last for the completion of my ruin it
pleased Providence to chastise me in a still more cruel manner and to
turn my thoughts to your deceased aunt Fedulia Ivanovna sister of
Agrippina Ivanovna one in blood but not one in heart Having present
to myself before my minds eye that I had been for twenty years
devoted to the whole family of your kindred the Lomovs especially to
Fedulia Ivanovna who never called Agrippina Ivanovna otherwise than my
hearts precious treasure and me the most honoured and zealous friend
of our family picturing all the above among abundant tears and sighs
in the stillness of sorrowful night watches I thought Come
brigadier so it seems it is to be and addressing myself by letter
to the said Fedulia Ivanovna I received a positive assurance that she
would share her last crumb with me The presents sent on by me more
than five hundred roubles worth in value were accepted with supreme
satisfaction and afterwards the money too which I brought with me for
my maintenance Fedulia Ivanovna was pleased on the pretext of guarding
it to take into her care to the which to gratify her I offered no
opposition

If you ask me whence and on what ground I conceived such confidenceto
the above madam there is but one reply she was sister of Agrippina
Ivanovna and a member of the Lomov family But alas and alas all the
money aforesaid I was very soon deprived of and the hopes which I had
rested on Fedulia Ivanovnathat she would share her last crumb with
meturned out to be empty and vain on the contrary the said Fedulia
Ivanovna enriched herself with my property To wit on her saints day
the fifth of February I brought her fifty roubles worth of green
French material at five roubles the yard I myself received of all that
was promised five roubles worth of white piqu for a waistcoat and a
muslin handkerchief for my neck which gifts were purchased in my
presence as I was aware with my own moneyand that was all that I
profited by Fedulia Ivanovnas bounty So much for the last crumb And I
could further in all sincerity disclose the malignant doings of
Fedulia Ivanovna to me and also my expenses exceeding all reason as
among the rest for sweetmeats and fruits of which Fedulia Ivanovna was
exceedingly fondbut upon all this I am silent that you may not take
such disclosures against the dead in bad part and also seeing that God
has called her before His judgment seatand all that I suffered at her
hands is blotted out from my heartand I as a Christian forgave her
long ago and pray to God to forgive her

But honoured madam Rassa Pavlovna Surely you will not blame me for
that I was a true and loyal friend of your family and that I loved
Agrippina Ivanovna with a love so great and so insurmountable that I
sacrificed to her my life my honour and all my fortune that I was
utterly in her hands and hence could not dispose of myself nor of my
property and she disposed at her will of me and also of my estate It
is known to you also that owing to her action with her servant I
suffer though innocent a deadly wrongthis affair I brought after her
death before the senate before the sixth departmentit is still
unsettled nowin consequence of which I was made accomplice with her
my estate put under guardianship and I am still lying under a criminal
charge In my position at my age such disgrace is intolerable to me
and it is only left me to console my heart with the mournful reflection
that thus even after Agrippina Ivanovnas death I suffer for her sake
and so prove my immutable love and loyal gratitude to her

In my letters above mentioned to you I gave you an account with
every detail of Agrippina Ivanovnas funeral and what masses were read
for hermy affection and love for her spared no outlay For all the
aforesaid and for the forty days requiems and the reading of the
psalter six weeks after for her in addition to above fifty roubles
of mine were lost which were given as security for payment for
the stone of which I sent you a descriptionon all the aforesaid
was spent of my money seven hundred and fifty roubles in which is
included by way of donation to the church a hundred and fifty roubles

In the goodness of your heart hear the cry of a desperate man crushed
beneath a load of the crudest calamities Only your commiseration and
humanity can restore the life of a ruined man Though livingin the
suffering of my heart and soul I am as one dead dead when I think what
I was and what I am I was a soldier and served my country in all
fidelity and uprightness as is the bounden duty of a loyal Russian and
faithful subject and was rewarded with the highest honours and had a
fortune befitting my birth and station and now I must cringe and beg
for a morsel of dry bread dead above all I am when I think what a
friend I have lost  and what is life to me after that But there is
no hastening ones end and the earth will not open but rather seems
turned to stone And so I call upon you in the benevolence of your
heart hush the talk of the people do not expose yourself to universal
censure that for all my unbounded devotion I have not where to lay my
head confound them by your bounty to me turn the tongues of the evil
speakers and slanderers to glorifying your good worksand I make bold
in all humility to add comfort in the grave your most precious aunt
Agrippina Ivanovna who can never be forgotten and who for your speedy
succour in answer to my sinful prayers will spread her protecting
wings about your head and comfort in his declining days a lonely old
man who had every reason to expect a different fate  And with the
most profound respect I have the honour to be dear madam your most
devoted servant

VASSILY GUSKOV

Brigadier and cavalier

Several years later I paid another visit to my friends little place
Vassily Fomitch had long been dead he died soon after I made his
acquaintance Cucumber was still flourishing He conducted me to the
tomb of Agrafena Ivanovna An iron railing enclosed a large slab with a
detailed and enthusiastically laudatory epitaph on the deceased woman
and there beside it as it were at her feet could be seen a little
mound with a slanting cross on it the servant of God the brigadier and
cavalier Vassily Guskov lay under this mound His ashes found rest
at last beside the ashes of the creature he had loved with such
unbounded almost undying love






PYETUSHKOV




I


In the year   there was living in the town of O the
lieutenant Ivan Afanasiitch Pyetushkov He was born of poor parents was
left an orphan at five years old and came into the charge of a
guardian Thanks to this guardian he found himself with no property
whatever he had a hard struggle to make both ends meet He was of
medium height and stooped a little he had a thin face covered with
freckles but rather pleasing light brown hair grey eyes and a timid
expression his low forehead was furrowed with fine wrinkles
Pyetushkovs whole life had been uneventful in the extreme at close
upon forty he was still youthful and inexperienced as a child He was
shy with acquaintances and exceedingly mild in his manner with persons
over whose lot he could have exerted control

People condemned by fate to a monotonous and cheerless existence often
acquire all sorts of little habits and preferences Pyetushkov liked to
have a new white roll with his tea every morning He could not do
without this dainty But behold one morning his servant Onisim handed
him on a bluesprigged plate instead of a roll three dark red rusks

Pyetushkov at once asked his servant with some indignation what he
meant by it

The rolls have all been sold out answered Onisim a native of
Petersburg who had been flung by some queer freak of destiny into the
very wilds of south Russia

Impossible exclaimed Ivan Afanasiitch

Sold out repeated Onisim theres a breakfast at the Marshals so
theyve all gone there you know

Onisim waved his hand in the air and thrust his right foot forward

Ivan Afanasiitch walked up and down the room dressed and set off
himself to the bakers shop This establishment the only one of the
kind in the town of O had been opened ten years before by a German
immigrant had in a short time begun to flourish and was still
flourishing under the guidance of his widow a fat woman

Pyetushkov tapped at the window The fat woman stuck her unhealthy
flabby sleepy countenance out of the pane that opened

A roll if you please Pyetushkov said amiably

The rolls are all gone piped the fat woman

Havent you any rolls

No

Hows thatreally I take rolls from you every day and pay for them
regularly

The woman stared at him in silence Take twists she said at last
yawning or a scone

I dont like them said Pyetushkov and he felt positively hurt

As you please muttered the fat woman and she slammed to the
windowpane

Ivan Afanasiitch was quite unhinged by his intense vexation In his
perturbation he crossed to the other side of the street and gave
himself up entirely like a child to his displeasure

Sir  he heard a rather agreeable female voice sir

Ivan Afanasiitch raised his eyes From the open pane of the bakehouse
window peeped a girl of about seventeen holding a white roll in her
hand She had a full round face rosy cheeks small hazel eyes rather a
turnup nose fair hair and magnificent shoulders Her features
suggested goodnature laziness and carelessness

Heres a roll for you sir she said laughing Id taken for myself
but take it please Ill give it up to you

I thank you most sincerely Allow me 

Pyetushkov began fumbling in his pocket

No no you are welcome to it

She closed the windowpane

Pyetushkov arrived home in a perfectly agreeable frame of mind

You couldnt get any rolls he said to his Onisim but here Ive got
one do you see

Onisim gave a bitter laugh

The same day in the evening as Ivan Afanasiitch was undressing he
asked his servant Tell me please my lad whats the girl like at the
bakers hey

Onisim looked away rather gloomily and responded What do you want to
know for

Oh nothing said Pyetushkov taking off his boots with his own hands

Well shes a fine girl Onisim observed condescendingly

Yes  shes not badlooking said Ivan Afanasiitch also looking
away And whats her name do you know

Vassilissa

And do you know her

Onisim did not answer for a minute or two

We know her

Pyetushkov was on the point of opening his mouth again but he turned
over on the other side and fell asleep

Onisim went out into the passage took a pinch of snuff and gave his
head a violent shake

The next day early in the morning Pyetushkov called for his clothes
Onisim brought him his everyday coatan old grasscoloured coat with
huge striped epaulettes Pyetushkov gazed a long while at Onisim without
speaking then told him to bring him his new coat Onisim with some
surprise obeyed Pyetushkov dressed and carefully drew on his
chamoisleather gloves

You neednt go to the bakers today said he with some hesitation
Im going myself  its on my way

Yes sir responded Onisim as abruptly as if some one had just given
him a shove from behind

Pyetushkov set off reached the bakers shop tapped at the window The
fat woman opened the pane

Give me a roll please Ivan Afanasiitch articulated slowly

The fat woman stuck out an arm bare to the shouldera huge arm more
like a leg than an armand thrust the hot bread just under his nose

Ivan Afanasiitch stood some time under the window walked once or twice
up and down the street glanced into the courtyard and at last ashamed
of his childishness returned home with the roll in his hand He felt
ill at ease the whole day and even in the evening contrary to his
habit did not drop into conversation with Onisim

The next morning it was Onisim who went
for the roll




II


Some weeks went by Ivan Afanasiitch had completely forgotten
Vassilissa and chatted in a friendly way with his servant as before
One fine morning there came to see him a certain Bublitsyn an
easymannered and very agreeable young man It is true he sometimes
hardly knew himself what he was talking about and was always as they
say a little wild but all the same he had the reputation of being an
exceedingly agreeable person to talk to He smoked a great deal with
feverish eagerness with lifted eyebrows and contracted chestsmoked
with an expression of intense anxiety or one might rather say with an
expression as though let him have this one more puff at his pipe and
in a minute he would tell you some quite unexpected piece of news at
times he would even give a grunt and a wave of the hand while himself
sucking at his pipe as though he had suddenly recollected something
extraordinarily amusing or important then he would open his mouth let
off a few rings of smoke and utter the most commonplace remarks or
even keep silence altogether After gossiping a little with Ivan
Afanasiitch about the neighbours about horses the daughters of the
gentry around and other such edifying topics Mr Bublitsyn suddenly
winked pulled up his shock of hair and with a sly smile approached
the remarkably dim lookingglass which was the solitary ornament of Ivan
Afanasiitchs room

Theres no denying the fact he pronounced stroking his light brown
whiskers weve got girls here that beat any of your Venus of Medicis
hollow Have you seen Vassilissa the baker girl for instance 
Mr Bublitsyn sucked at his pipe

Pyetushkov started

But why do I ask you pursued Bublitsyn disappearing in a cloud of
smokeyoure not the man to notice dont you know Ivan Afanasiitch
Goodness knows what you do to occupy yourself Ivan Afanasiitch

The same as you do Pyetushkov replied with some vexation in a
drawling voice

Oh no Ivan Afanasiitch not a bit of it How can you say so

Well why not

Nonsense nonsense

Why so why so

Bublitsyn stuck his pipe in the corner of his mouth and began
scrutinising his not very handsome boots Pyetushkov felt embarrassed

Ah Ivan Afanasiitch Ivan Afanasiitch pursued Bublitsyn as though
sparing his feelings But as to Vassilissa the baker girl I can
assure you a very very fine girl  very

Mr Bublitsyn dilated his nostrils and slowly plunged his hands into
his pockets

Strange to relate Ivan Afanasiitch felt something of the nature of
jealousy He began moving restlessly in his chair burst into explosive
laughter at nothing at all suddenly blushed yawned and as he yawned
his lower jaw twitched a little Bublitsyn smoked three more pipes and
withdrew Ivan Afanasiitch went to the window sighed and called for
something to drink

Onisim set a glass of kvas on the table glanced severely at his master
leaned back against the door and hung his head dejectedly

What are you so thoughtful about his master asked him genially but
with some inward trepidation

What am I thinking about retorted Onisim what am I thinking
about  its always about you

About me

Of course its about you

Why what is it you are thinking

Why this is what Im thinking Here Onisim took a pinch of snuff
You ought to be ashamed siryou ought to be ashamed of yourself

Ashamed

Yes ashamed Look at Mr Bublitsyn Ivan Afanasiitch Tell me if
hes not a fine fellow now

I dont understand you

You dont understand me Oh yes you do understand me

Onisim paused

Mr Bublitsyns a real gentlemanwhat a gentleman ought to be But
what are you Ivan Afanasiitch what are you Tell me that

Why Im a gentleman too

A gentleman indeed  retorted Onisim growing indignant A pretty
gentleman you are Youre no better sir than a hen in a shower of
rain Ivan Afanasiitch let me tell you Here you sit sticking at home
the whole blessed day  much good it does you sitting at home like
that You dont play cards you dont go and see the gentry and as
for  well 

Onisim waved his hand expressively

Now come  you really go  too far  Ivan Afanasiitch said
hesitatingly clutching his pipe

Too far indeed Ivan Afanasiitch too far you say Judge for
yourself Here again with Vassilissa  why couldnt you 

But what are you thinking about Onisim Pyetushkov interrupted
miserably

I know what Im thinking about But thereId better let you alone
What can you do Only fancy  there you 

Ivan Afanasiitch got up

There there if you please you hold your tongue he said quickly
seeming to be searching for Onisim with his eyes I shall really
you know  I  what do you mean by it really Youd better help
me dress

Onisim slowly drew off Ivan Afanasiitchs greasy Tartar dressinggown
gazed with fatherly commiseration at his master shook his head put him
on his coat and fell to beating him about the back with a brush

Pyetushkov went out and after a not very protracted stroll about the
crooked streets of the town found himself facing the bakers shop A
queer smile was playing about his lips

He had hardly time to look twice at the too wellknown establishment
when suddenly the little gate opened and Vassilissa ran out with a
yellow kerchief on her head and a jacket flung after the Russian fashion
on her shoulders Ivan Afanasiitch at once overtook her

Where are you going my dear

Vassilissa glanced swiftly at him laughed turned away and put her
hand over her lips

Going shopping I suppose queried Ivan Afanasiitch fidgeting
with his feet

How inquisitive we are retorted Vassilissa

Why inquisitive said Pyetushkov hurriedly gesticulating with his
hands Quite the contrary Oh yes you know he added hastily as
though these last words completely conveyed his meaning

Did you eat my roll

To be sure I did replied Pyetushkov with special enjoyment

Vassilissa continued to walk on and to laugh

Its pleasant weather today pursued Ivan Afanasiitch do you often
go out walking

Yes

Ah how I should like

What say

The girls in our district utter those words in a very queer way with a
peculiar sharpness and rapidity Partridges call at sunset with just
that sound

To go out walking dont you know with you  into the
country or 

How can you

Why not

Ah upon my word how you do go on

But allow me

At this point they were overtaken by a dapper little shopman with a
little goats beard and with his fingers held apart like antlers so as
to keep his sleeves from slipping over his hands in a longskirted
bluish coat and a warm cap that resembled a bloated watermelon
Pyetushkov for proprietys sake fell back a little behind Vassilissa
but quickly came up with her again

Well then what about our walk

Vassilissa looked slily at him and giggled again

Do you belong to these parts

Yes

Vassilissa passed her hand over her hair and walked a little more
slowly Ivan Afanasiitch smiled and his heart inwardly sinking with
timidity he stooped a little on one side and put a trembling arm about
the beautys waist

Vassilissa uttered a shriek

Give over do for shame in the street

Come now there there muttered Ivan Afanasiitch

Give over I tell you in the street Dont be rude

A  a  ah what a girl you are said Pyetushkov reproachfully
while he blushed up to his ears

Vassilissa stood still

Now go along with you sirgo along do

Pyetushkov obeyed He got home and sat for a whole hour without moving
from his chair without even smoking his pipe At last he took out a
sheet of greyish paper mended a pen and after long deliberation wrote
the following letter

DEAR MADAM VASSILISSA TIMOFYEVNABeing naturally a most inoffensive
person how could I have occasioned you annoyance If I have really been
to blame in my conduct to you then I must tell you the hints of Mr
Bublitsyn were responsible for this which was what I never expected
Anyway I must humbly beg you not to be angry with me I am a sensitive
man and any kindness I am most sensible of and grateful for Do not be
angry with me Vassilissa Timofyevna I beg you most humblyI remain
respectfully your obedient servant

IVAN PYETUSHKOV

Onisim carried this letter to its address




III


A fortnight passed Onisim went every morning as usual to the bakers
shop One day Vassilissa ran out to meet him

Good morning Onisim Sergeitch

Onisim put on a gloomy expression and responded crossly Morning

How is it you never come to see us Onisim Sergeitch

Onisim glanced morosely at her

What should I come for you wouldnt give me a cup of tea no fear

Yes I would Onisim Sergeitch I would You come and see Rum
in it too

Onisim slowly relaxed into a smile

Well I dont mind if I do then

When thenwhen

When  well you are 

Todaythis evening if you like Drop in

All right Ill come along replied Onisim and he sauntered home with
his slow rolling step

The same evening in a little room beside a bed covered with a striped
eiderdown Onisim was sitting at a clumsy little table facing
Vassilissa A huge dingy yellow samovar was hissing and bubbling on the
table a pot of geranium stood in the window in the other corner near
the door there stood aslant an ugly chest with a tiny hanging lock on
the chest lay a shapeless heap of all sorts of old rags on the walls
were black greasy prints Onisim and Vassilissa drank their tea in
silence looking straight at each other turning the lumps of sugar over
and over in their hands as it were reluctantly nibbling them blinking
screwing up their eyes and with a hissing sound sucking in the
yellowish boiling liquid through their teeth At last they had emptied
the whole samovar turned upside down the round cupsone with the
inscription Take your fill the other with the words Cupids dart
hath pierced my heartthen they cleared their throats wiped their
perspiring brows and gradually dropped into conversation

Onisim Sergeitch how about your master  began Vassilissa and did
not finish her sentence

What about my master replied Onisim and he leaned on his hand Hes
all right But why do you ask

Oh I only asked answered Vassilissa

But I sayhere Onisim grinnedI say he wrote you a letter
didnt he

Yes he did

Onisim shook his head with an extraordinarily selfsatisfied air

So he did did he he said huskily with a smile Well and what did
he say in his letter to you

Oh all sorts of things I didnt mean anything Madam Vassilissa
Timofyevna says he dont you think anything of it dont you be
offended madam and a lot more like that he wrote But I say she
added after a brief silence whats he like

Hes all right Onisim responded indifferently

Does he get angry

He get angry Not he Why do you like him

Vassilissa looked down and giggled in her sleeve

Come grumbled Onisim

Oh whats that to you Onisim Sergeitch

Oh come I tell you

Well Vassilissa brought out at last hes  a gentleman Of
course  I  and besides he  you know yourself 

Of course I do Onisim observed solemnly

Of course youre aware to be sure Onisim Sergeitch  Vassilissa
was obviously becoming agitated

You tell him your master that Im  say not angry with him
but that 

She stammered

We understand responded Onisim and he got up from his seat We
understand Thanks for the entertainment

Come in again some day

All right all right

Onisim approached the door The fat woman came into the room

Good evening to you Onisim Sergeitch she said in a peculiar chant

Good evening to you Praskovia Ivanovna he said in the same
singsong

Both stood still for a little while facing each other

Well good day to you Praskovia Ivanovna Onisim chanted out again

Well good day to you Onisim Sergeitch she responded in the same
singsong

Onisim arrived home His master was lying on his bed gazing at
the ceiling

Where have you been

Where have I been  Onisim had the habit of repeating reproachfully
the last words of every question Ive been about your business

What business

Why dont you know  Ive been to see Vassilissa

Pyetushkov blinked and turned over on his bed

So thats how it is observed Onisim and he coolly took a pinch of
snuff So thats how it is Youre always like that Vassilissa sends
you her duty

Really

Really So thats all about it Really  She told me to say Why is
it says she one never sees him Why is it says she he never comes

Well and what did you say

What did I say I told her Youre a silly girlI told heras if
folks like that are coming to see you No you come yourself I
told her

Well and what did she say

What did she say  She said nothing

That is how do you mean nothing

Why nothing to be sure

Pyetushkov said nothing for a little while

Well and is she coming

Onisim shook his head

She coming Youre in too great a hurry sir She coming indeed No
you go too fast 

But you said yourself that 

Oh well its easy to talk

Pyetushkov was silent again

Well but hows it to be then my lad

How  You ought to know best you re a gentleman

Oh nonsense come now

Onisim swayed complacently backwards and forwards

Do you know Praskovia Ivanovna he asked at last

No What Praskovia Ivanovna

Why the baker woman

Oh yes the baker woman Ive seen her shes very fat

Shes a worthy woman Shes own aunt to the other to your girl

Aunt

Why didnt you know

No I didnt know

Well 

Onisim was restrained by respect for his master from giving full
expression to his feelings

Thats whom it is you should make friends with

Well Ive no objection

Onisim looked approvingly at Ivan Afanasiitch

But with what object precisely am I to make friends with her inquired
Pyetushkov

What for indeed answered Onisim serenely

Ivan Afanasiitch got up paced up and down the room stood still before
the window and without turning his head with some hesitation he
articulated

Onisim

What say

Wont it be you know a little awkward for me with the old woman eh

Oh thats as you like

Oh well I only thought it might perhaps My comrades might
notice it its a little  But Ill think it over Give me my
pipe So she he went on after a short silenceVassilissa I
mean says then 

But Onisim had no desire to continue the conversation and he assumed
his habitual morose expression




IV


Ivan Afanasiitchs acquaintance with Praskovia Ivanovna began in the
following manner Five days after his conversation with Onisim
Pyetushkov set off in the evening to the bakers shop Well thought
he as he unlatched the creaking gate I dont know how its to be 

He mounted the steps opened the door A huge crested hen rushed with
a deafening cackle straight under his feet and long after was still
running about the yard in wild excitement From a room close by peeped
the astonished countenance of the fat woman Ivan Afanasiitch smiled and
nodded The fat woman bowed to him Tightly grasping his hat Pyetushkov
approached her Praskovia Ivanovna was apparently anticipating an
honoured guest her dress was fastened up at every hook Pyetushkov sat
down on a chair Praskovia Ivanovna seated herself opposite him

I have come to you Praskovia Ivanovna more on account of Ivan
Afanasiitch began at lastand then ceased His lips were twitching
spasmodically

You are kindly welcome sir responded Praskovia Ivanovna in the
proper singsong and with a bow Always delighted to see a guest

Pyetushkov took courage a little

I have long wished you know to have the pleasure of making your
acquaintance Praskovia Ivanovna

Much obliged to you Ivan Afanasiitch

Followed a silence Praskovia Ivanovna wiped her face with a
particoloured handkerchief Ivan Afanasiitch continued with intense
attention to gaze away to one side Both were rather uncomfortable But
in merchant and petty shopkeeper society where even old friends never
step outside special angular forms of etiquette a certain constraint in
the behaviour of guests and host to one another not only strikes no one
as strange but on the contrary is regarded as perfectly correct and
indispensable particularly on a first visit Praskovia Ivanovna was
agreeably impressed by Pyetushkov He was formal and decorous in his
manners and moreover wasnt he a man of some rank too

Praskovia Ivanovna maam I like your rolls very much he said to
her

Really now really now

Very good they are you know very indeed

May they do you good sir may they do you good Delighted to be
sure

Ive never eaten any like them in Moscow

You dont say so now you dont say so

Again a silence followed

Tell me Praskovia Ivanovna began Ivan Afanasiitch thats your
niece I fancy isnt it living with you

My own niece sir

How comes it  shes with you

Shes an orphan so I keep her

And is she a good worker

Such a girl to work  such a girl sir  ay  ay  to be
sure she is

Ivan Afanasiitch thought it discreet not to pursue the subject of the
niece further

What bird is that you have in the cage Praskovia Ivanovna

God knows A bird of some sort

Hm Well so good day to you Praskovia Ivanovna

A very good day to your honour Pray walk in another time and take a
cup of tea

With the greatest pleasure Praskovia Ivanovna

Pyetushkov walked out On the steps he met Vassilissa She giggled

Where are you going my darling said Pyetushkov with reckless daring

Come give over do you are a one for joking

He he And did you get my letter

Vassilissa hid the lower part of her face in her sleeve and made
no answer

And youre not angry with me

Vassilissa came the jarring voice of the aunt hey Vassilissa

Vassilissa ran into the house Pyetushkov returned home But from that
day he began going often to the bakers shop and his visits were not
for nothing Ivan Afanasiitchs hopes to use the lofty phraseology
suitable were crowned with success Usually the attainment of the goal
has a cooling effect on people but Pyetushkov on the contrary grew
every day more and more ardent Love is a thing of accident it exists
in itself like art and like nature needs no reasons to justify it
as some clever man has said who never loved himself but made excellent
observations upon love

Pyetushkov became passionately attached to Vassilissa He was completely
happy His soul was aglow with bliss Little by little he carried all
his belongings at any rate all his pipes to Praskovia Ivanovnas and
for whole days together he sat in her back room Praskovia Ivanovna
charged him something for his dinner and drank his tea consequently she
did not complain of his presence Vassilissa had grown used to him She
would work sing or spin before him sometimes exchanging a couple of
words with him Pyetushkov watched her smoked his pipe swayed to and
fro in his chair laughed and in leisure hours played Fools with her
and Praskovia Ivanovna Ivan Afanasiitch was happy

But in this world nothing is perfect and small as a mans
requirements may be destiny never quite fulfils them and positively
spoils the whole thing if possible The spoonful of pitch is sure
to find its way into the barrel of honey Ivan Afanasiitch experienced
this in his case

In the first place from the time of his establishing himself at
Vassilissas Pyetushkov dropped more than ever out of all intercourse
with his comrades He saw them only when absolutely necessary and then
to avoid allusions and jeers in which however he was not always
successful he put on the desperately sullen and intensely scared look
of a hare in a display of fireworks

Secondly Onisim gave him no peace he had lost every trace of respect
for him he mercilessly persecuted him put him to shame

And  thirdly Alas read further kindly reader




V


One day Pyetushkov who for the reasons given above found little comfort
outside Praskovia Ivanovnas doors was sitting in Vassilissas room at
the back and was busying himself over some homebrewed concoction
something in the way of jam or syrup The mistress of the house was not
at home Vassilissa was sitting in the shop singing

There came a knock at the little pane Vassilissa got up went to the
window uttered a little shriek giggled and began whispering with some
one On going back to her place she sighed and then fell to singing
louder than ever

Who was that you were talking to Pyetushkov asked her

Vassilissa went on singing carelessly

Vassilissa do you hear Vassilissa

What do you want

Whom were you talking to

Whats that to you

I only asked

Pyetushkov came out of the back room in a particoloured smokingjacket
with tuckedup sleeves and a strainer in his hand

Oh a friend of mine answered Vassilissa

What friend

Oh Piotr Petrovitch

Piotr Petrovitch  what Piotr Petrovitch

Hes one of your lot Hes got such a difficult name

Bublitsyn

Yes yes  Piotr Petrovitch

And do you know him

Rather responded Vassilissa with a wag of her head

Pyetushkov without a word paced ten times up and down the room

I say Vassilissa he said at last that is how do you know him

How do I know him  I know him  Hes such a nice gentleman

How do you mean nice though how nice how nice

Vassilissa gazed at Ivan Afanasiitch

Nice she said slowly and in perplexity You know what I mean

Pyetushkov bit his lips and began again pacing the room

What were you talking about with him eh

Vassilissa smiled and looked down

Speak speak speak I tell you speak

How cross you are today observed Vassilissa

Pyetushkov was silent

Come now Vassilissa he began at last no I wont be cross
Come tell me what were you talking about

Vassilissa laughed

He is a one to joke really that Piotr Petrovitch

Well what did he say

He is a fellow

Pyetushkov was silent again for a little

Vassilissa you love me dont you he asked her

Oh so thats what youre after too

Poor Pyetushkov felt a pang at his heart Praskovia Ivanovna came in
They sat down to dinner After dinner Praskovia Ivanovna betook herself
to the shelf bed Ivan Afanasiitch himself lay down on the stove turned
over and dropped asleep A cautious creak waked him Ivan Afanasiitch
sat up leaned on his elbow looked the door was open He jumped upno
Vassilissa He ran into the yardshe was not in the yard into the
street looked up and downVassilissa was nowhere to be seen He ran
without his cap as far as the marketno Vassilissa was not in sight
Slowly he returned to the bakers shop clambered on to the stove and
turned with his face to the wall He felt miserable Bublitsyn 
Bublitsyn  the name was positively ringing in his ears

Whats the matter my good sir Praskovia Ivanovna asked him in a
drowsy voice Why are you groaning

Oh nothing maam Nothing I feel a weight oppressing me

Its the mushrooms murmured Praskovia Ivanovnaits all those
mushrooms

O Lord have mercy on us sinners

An hour passed a secondstill no Vassilissa Twenty times Pyetushkov
was on the point of getting up and twenty times he huddled miserably
under the sheepskin At last he really did get down from the stove
and determined to go home and positively went out into the yard but
came back Praskovia Ivanovna got up The hired man Luka black as a
beetle though he was a baker put the bread into the oven Pyetushkov
went again out on to the steps and pondered The goat that lived in the
yard went up to him and gave him a little friendly poke with his horns
Pyetushkov looked at him and for some unknown reason said Kss Kss
Suddenly the low wicketgate slowly opened and Vassilissa appeared Ivan
Afanasiitch went straight to meet her took her by the hand and rather
coolly but resolutely said to her

Come along with me

But excuse me Ivan Afanasiitch  I 

Come with me he repeated

She obeyed

Pyetushkov led her to his lodgings Onisim as usual was lying at full
length asleep Ivan Afanasiitch waked him told him to light a candle
Vassilissa went to the window and sat down in silence While Onisim was
busy getting a light in the anteroom Pyetushkov stood motionless at the
other window staring into the street Onisim came in with the candle
in his hands was beginning to grumble  Ivan Afanasiitch turned
quickly round Go along he said to him

Onisim stood still in the middle of the room

Go away at once Pyetushkov repeated threateningly

Onisim looked at his master and went out

Ivan Afanasiitch shouted after him

Away quite away Out of the house You can come back in two
hours time

Onisim slouched off

Pyetushkov waited till he heard the gate bang and at once went up to
Vassilissa

Where have you been

Vassilissa was confused

Where have you been I tell you he repeated

Vassilissa looked round 

I am speaking to you  where have you been And Pyetushkov raised
his arm 

Dont beat me Ivan Afanasiitch dont beat me Vassilissa whispered
in terror

Pyetushkov turned away

Beat you  No Im not going to beat you Beat you I beg your
pardon my darling God bless you While I supposed you loved me while
I  I  

Ivan Afanasiitch broke off He gasped for breath

Listen Vassilissa he said at last You know Im a kindhearted man
you know it dont you Vassilissa dont you

Yes I do she said faltering

I do nobody any harm nobody nobody in the world And I deceive
nobody Why are you deceiving me

But Im not deceiving you Ivan Afanasiitch

You arent deceiving me Oh very well Oh very well Then tell me
where youve been

I went to see Matrona

Thats a lie

Really Ive been at Matronas You ask her if you dont believe me

And Bubwhats his name  have you seen that devil

Yes I did see him

You did see him you did see him Oh you did see him

Pyetushkov turned pale

So you were making an appointment with him in the morning at the
windoweh eh

He asked me to come

And so you went Thanks very much my girl thanks very much
Pyetushkov made Vassilissa a low bow

But Ivan Afanasiitch youre maybe fancying 

Youd better not talk to me And a pretty fool I am Theres nothing to
make an outcry for You may make friends with any one you like Ive
nothing to do with you So there I dont want to know you even

Vassilissa got up

Thats for you to say Ivan Afanasiitch

Where are you going

Why you yourself 

Im not sending you away Pyetushkov interrupted her

Oh no Ivan Afanasiitch Whats the use of my stopping here

Pyetushkov let her get as far as the door

So youre going Vassilissa

You keep on abusing me

I abuse you Youve no fear of God Vassilissa When have I abused you
Come come say when

Why Just this minute werent you all but beating me

Vassilissa its wicked of you Really its downright wicked

And then you threw it in my face that you dont want to know me Im
a gentleman say you

Ivan Afanasiitch began wringing his hands speechlessly Vassilissa got
back as far as the middle of the room

Well God be with you Ivan Afanasiitch Ill keep myself to myself
and you keep yourself to yourself

Nonsense Vassilissa nonsense Pyetushkov cut her short You think
again look at me You see Im not myself You see I dont know what Im
saying You might have some feeling for me

You keep on abusing me Ivan Afanasiitch

Ah Vassilissa Let bygones be bygones Isnt that right Come youre
not angry with me are you

I wont my love I wont Forgive an old man like me Ill never do it
in future Come youve forgiven me eh

God be with you Ivan Afanasiitch

Come laugh then laugh

Vassilissa turned away

You laughed you laughed my love cried Pyetushkov and he capered
about like a child




VI


The next day Pyetushkov went to the bakers shop as usual Everything
went on as before But there was a settled ache at his heart He did not
laugh now as often and sometimes he fell to musing Sunday came
Praskovia Ivanovna had an attack of lumbago she did not get down from
the shelf bed except with much difficulty to go to mass After mass
Pyetushkov called Vassilissa into the back room She had been
complaining all the morning of feeling dull To judge by the expression
of Ivan Afanasiitchs countenance he was revolving in his brain some
extraordinary idea unforeseen even by him

You sit down here Vassilissa he said to her and Ill sit here I
want to have a little talk with you

Vassilissa sat down

Tell me Vassilissa can you write

Write

Yes write

No I cant

What about reading

I cant read either

Then who read you my letter

The deacon

Pyetushkov paused

But would you like to learn to read and write

Why what use would reading and writing be to us Ivan Afanasiitch

What use You could read books

But what good is there in books

All sorts of good  I tell you what if you like Ill bring
you a book

But I cant read you see Ivan Afanasiitch

Ill read to you

But I say wont it be dull

Nonsense dull On the contrary its the best thing to get rid
of dulness

Maybe youll read stories then

You shall see tomorrow

In the evening Pyetushkov returned home and began rummaging in his
boxes He found several odd numbers of the Library of Good Reading five
grey Moscow novels Nazarovs arithmetic a childs geography with a
globe on the titlepage the second part of Keydanovs history two
dreambooks an almanack for the year  two numbers of Galatea
Kozlovs Natalia Dolgorukaia and the first part of Roslavlev He
pondered a long while which to choose and finally made up his mind to
take Kozlovs poem and Roslavlev

Next day Pyetushkov dressed in haste put both the books under the lapel
of his coat went to the bakers shop and began reading aloud
Zagoskins novel Vassilissa sat without moving at first she smiled
then seemed to become absorbed in thought  then she bent a little
forward her eyes closed her mouth slightly opened her hands fell on
her knees she was dozing Pyetushkov read quickly inarticulately in a
thick voice he raised his eyes 

Vassilissa are you asleep

She started rubbed her face and stretched Pyetushkov felt angry with
her and with himself

Its dull said Vassilissa lazily

I tell you what would you like me to read you poetry

What say

Poetry  good poetry

No thats enough really

Pyetushkov hurriedly picked up Kozlovs poem jumped up crossed the
room ran impulsively up to Vassilissa and began reading Vassilissa
let her head drop backwards spread out her hands stared into Ivan
Afanasiitchs face and suddenly went off into a loud harsh guffaw 
she fairly rolled about with laughing

Ivan Afanasiitch flung the book on the floor in his annoyance
Vassilissa went on laughing

Why what are you laughing at silly

Vassilissa roared more than ever

Laugh away laugh away Pyetushkov muttered between his teeth

Vassilissa held her sides gasping

But what is it idiot But Vassilissa could only wave her hands

Ivan Afanasiitch snatched up his cap and ran out of the house With
rapid unsteady steps he walked about the town walked on and on and
found himself at the city gates Suddenly there was the rattle of
wheels the tramp of horses along the street Some one called him by
name He raised his head and saw a big oldfashioned wagonette In the
wagonette facing him sat Mr Bublitsyn between two young ladies the
daughters of Mr Tiutiurov Both the girls were dressed exactly alike
as though in outward sign of their immutable affection both smiled
pensively and carried their heads on one side with a languid grace On
the other side of the carriage appeared the wide straw hat of their
excellent papa and from time to time his round plump neck presented
itself to the gaze of spectators Beside his straw hat rose the mobcap
of his spouse The very attitude of both the parents was a sufficient
proof of their sincere goodwill towards the young man and their
confidence in him And Bublitsyn obviously was aware of their flattering
confidence and appreciated it He was of course sitting in an
unconstrained position and talking and laughing without constraint but
in the very freedom of his manner there could be discerned a shade of
tender touching respectfulness And the Tiutiurov girls It is hard to
convey in words all that an attentive observer could trace in the faces
of the two sisters Goodwill and gentleness and discreet gaiety a
melancholy comprehension of life and a faith not to be shaken in
themselves in the lofty and noble destiny of man on earth courteous
attention to their young companion in intellectual endowments perhaps
not fully their equal but still by the qualities of his heart quite
deserving of their indulgence  such were the characteristics and the
feelings reflected at that moment on the faces of the young ladies
Bublitsyn called to Ivan Afanasiitch for no special reason simply in
the fulness of his inner satisfaction he bowed to him with excessive
friendliness and cordiality The young ladies even looked at him with
gentle amiability as at a man whose acquaintance they would not object
to The good sleek quiet horses went by Ivan Afanasiitch at a
gentle trot the carriage rolled smoothly along the broad road carrying
with it goodhumoured girlish laughter he caught a final glimpse of
Mr Tiutiurovs hat the two outer horses turned their heads on each
side jauntily stepping over the short green grass  the coachman gave
a whistle of approbation and warning the carriage disappeared behind
some willows

A long while poor Pyetushkov remained standing still

Im a poor lonely creature he whispered at last  alone in
the world

A little boy in tatters stopped before him looked timidly at him held
out his hand 

For Christs sake good gentleman

Pyetushkov pulled out a copper

For your loneliness poor orphan he said with effort and he walked
back to the bakers shop On the threshold of Vassilissas room Ivan
Afanasiitch stopped

Yes he thought these are my friends Here is my family this is
it And here Bublitsyn and there Bublitsyn

Vassilissa was sitting with her back to him winding worsted and
carelessly singing to herself she was wearing a striped cotton gown
her hair was done up anyhow The room insufferably hot smelt of
feather beds and old rags jaunty reddishbrown Prussians scurried
rapidly here and there across the walls on the decrepit chest of
drawers with holes in it where the locks should have been beside a
broken jar lay a womans shabby slipper Kozlovs poem was still
where it had fallen on the floor Pyetushkov shook his head folded
his arms and went away He was hurt

At home he called for his things to dress Onisim slouched off after his
better coat Pyetushkov had a great desire to draw Onisim into
conversation but Onisim preserved a sullen silence At last Ivan
Afanasiitch could hold out no longer

Why dont you ask me where Im going

Why what do I want to know where youre going for

What for Why suppose some one comes on urgent business and asks
Wheres Ivan Afanasiitch And then you can tell him Ivan Afanasiitch
has gone here or there

Urgent business But who ever does come to you on urgent business

Why are you beginning to be rude again Again hey

Onisim turned away and fell to brushing the coat

Really Onisim you are a most disagreeable person

Onisim looked up from under his brows at his master

And you re always like this Yes positively always

Onisim smiled

But whats the good of my asking you where youre going Ivan
Afanasiitch As though I didnt know To the girl at the bakers shop

There thats just where youre wrong thats just where youre
mistaken Not to her at all I dont intend going to see the girl at the
bakers shop any more

Onisim dropped his eyelids and brandished the brush Pyetushkov waited
for his approbation but his servant remained speechless

Its not the proper thing Pyetushkov went on in a severe voiceits
unseemly Come tell me what you think

What am I to think Its for you to say What business have I to
think

Pyetushkov put on his coat He doesnt believe me the beast he
thought to himself

He went out of the house but he did not go to see any one He walked
about the streets He directed his attention to the sunset At last a
little after eight oclock he returned home He wore a smile he
repeatedly shrugged his shoulders as though marvelling at his own
folly Yes thought he this is what comes of a strong will

Next day Pyetushkov got up rather late He had not passed a very good
night did not go out all day and was fearfully bored Pyetushkov read
through all his poor books and praised aloud one story in the Library
of Good Reading As he went to bed he told Onisim to give him his pipe
Onisim handed him a wretched pipe Pyetushkov began smoking the pipe
wheezed like a brokenwinded horse

How disgusting cried Ivan Afanasiitch wheres my cherry wood pipe

At the bakers shop Onisim responded tranquilly

Pyetushkov blinked spasmodically

Well you wish me to go for it

No you neednt dont go  no need dont go do you hear

Yes sir

The night passed somehow In the morning Onisim as usual gave
Pyetushkov on the blue sprigged plate a new white roll Ivan Afanasiitch
looked out of window and asked Onisim

Youve been to the bakers shop

Whos to go if I dont

Ah

Pyetushkov became plunged in meditation

Tell me please did you see any one there

Of course I did

Whom did you see there now for instance

Why of course Vassilissa

Ivan Afanasiitch was silent Onisim cleared the table and was just
going out of the room

Onisim Pyetushkov cried faintly

What is it

Er  did she ask after me

Of course she didnt

Pyetushkov set his teeth Yes he thought thats all its worth her
love indeed His head dropped Absurd I was to be sure he
thought again A fine idea to read her poetry A girl like that Why
shes a fool Why shes good for nothing but to lie on the stove and
eat pancakes Why shes a post a perfect post an uneducated
workgirl

Shes never come he whispered two hours later still sitting in the
same place shes never come To think of it why she could see that I
left her out of temper why she might know that I was hurt Theres
love for you And she did not even ask if I were well Never even said
Is Ivan Afanasiitch quite well She hasnt seen me for two whole
daysand not a sign Shes even again maybe thought fit to meet
that BubLucky fellow Ouf devil take it what a fool I am

Pyetushkov got up paced up and down the room in silence stood still
knitted his brows slightly and scratched his neck However he said
aloud Ill go to see her I must see what shes about there I must
make her feel ashamed Most certainly  Ill go Onisim my clothes

Well he mused as he dressed we shall see what comes of it She may
I dare say be angry with me And after all a man keeps coming and
coming and all of a sudden for no rhyme or reason goes and gives up
coming Well we shall see

Ivan Afanasiitch went out of the house and made his way to the bakers
shop He stopped at the little gate he wanted to straighten himself out
and set himself to rights Pyetushkov clutched at the folds of his
coat with both hands and almost pulled them out altogether
Convulsively he twisted his tightly compressed neck fastened the top
hook of his collar drew a deep breath

Why are you standing there Praskovia Ivanovna bawled to him from the
little window Come in

Pyetushkov started and went in Praskovia Ivanovna met him in
the doorway

Why didnt you come to see us yesterday my good sir Was it maybe
some ailment prevented you

Yes I had something of a headache yesterday

Ah you should have put cucumber on your temples my good sir It would
have taken it away in a twinkling Is your head aching now

No its not

Ah well and thank Thee O Lord for it

Ivan Afanasiitch went off into the back room Vassilissa saw him

Ah good day Ivan Afanasiitch

Good day Vassilissa Ivanovna

Where have you put the tap Ivan Afanasiitch

Tap what tap

The winetap  our tap You must have taken it home with you You are
such a one  Lord forgive us

Pyetushkov put on a dignified and chilly air

I will direct my man to look Seeing that I was not here yesterday he
pronounced significantly

Ah why to be sure you werent here yesterday Vassilissa squatted
down on her heels and began rummaging in the chest

Aunt hi aunt

What saay

Have you taken my neckerchief

What neckerchief

Why the yellow one

The yellow one

Yes the yellow figured one

No Ive not taken it

Pyetushkov bent down to Vassilissa

Listen to me Vassilissa listen to what I am saying to you It is not
a matter of taps or of neckerchiefs just now you can attend to such
trifles another time

Vassilissa did not budge from her position she only lifted her head

You just tell me on your conscience do you love me or not Thats
what I want to know once for all

Ah what a one you are Ivan Afanasiitch Well then of course

If you love me how was it you didnt come to see me yesterday Had you
no time Well you might have sent to find out if I were ill as I
didnt turn up But its little you cared I might die I dare say you
wouldnt grieve

Ah Ivan Afanasiitch one cant be always thinking of one thing ones
got ones work to do

To be sure responded Pyetushkov but all the same  And its
improper to laugh at your elders Its not right Moreover its as
well in certain cases  But wheres my pipe

Heres your pipe

Pyetushkov began smoking




VII


Several days slipped by again apparently rather tranquilly But a storm
was getting nearer Pyetushkov suffered tortures was jealous never
took his eyes off Vassilissa kept an alarmed watch over her annoyed
her horribly Behold one evening Vassilissa dressed herself with more
care than usual and seizing a favourable instant sallied off to make
a visit somewhere Night came on she had not returned Pyetushkov at
sunset went home to his lodgings and at eight oclock in the morning
ran to the bakers shop Vassilissa had not come in With an
inexpressible sinking at his heart he waited for her right up to
dinnertime They sat down to the table without her

Whatever can have become of her Praskovia Ivanovna observed
serenely

You spoil her you simply spoil her utterly Pyetushkov repeated
in despair

Eh my good sir theres no looking after a girl responded Praskovia
Ivanovna Let her go her way So long as she does her work Why
shouldnt folks enjoy themselves 

A cold shudder ran over Pyetushkov At last towards evening Vassilissa
made her appearance This was all he was waiting for Majestically
Pyetushkov rose from his seat folded his arms scowled menacingly
But Vassilissa looked him boldly in the face laughed impudently and
before he could utter a single word she went quickly into her own room
and locked herself in Ivan Afanasiitch opened his mouth looked in
amazement at Praskovia Ivanovna Praskovia Ivanovna cast down her
eyes Ivan Afanasiitch stood still a moment groped after his cap put
it on askew and went out without closing his mouth

He reached home took up a leather cushion and with it flung himself on
the sofa with his face to the wall Onisim looked in out of the
passage went into the room leaned his back against the door took a
pinch of snuff and crossed his legs

Are you unwell Ivan Afanasiitch he asked Pyetushkov

Pyetushkov made no answer

Shall I go for the doctor Onisim continued after a brief pause

Im quite well Go away Ivan Afanasiitch articulated huskily

Well  no youre not well Ivan Afanasiitch Is this what you
call being well

Pyetushkov did not speak

Just look at yourself Youve grown so thin that youre simply not
like yourself And whats it all about Its enough to turn ones brain
to think of it And you a gentleman born too

Onisim paused Pyetushkov did not stir

Is that the way gentlemen go on Theyd amuse themselves a bit to be
sure  why shouldnt they  theyd amuse themselves and then drop
it They may well say Fall in love with Old Nick and youll think
him a beauty

Ivan Afanasiitch merely writhed

Well its really like this Ivan Afanasiitch If any one had said this
and that of you and your goings on why I would have said Get along
with you you fool what do you take me for Do you suppose Id have
believed it Why as it is I see it with my own eyes and I cant
believe it Worse than this nothing can be Has she put some spell over
you or what Why what is there in her If you come to consider shes
below contempt really She cant even speak as she ought Shes
simply a baggage Worse even

Go away Ivan Afanasiitch moaned into the cushion

No Im not going away Ivan Afanasiitch Whos to speak if I dont
Why upon my word Here you re breaking your heart now  and over
what Eh over what tell me that

Oh go away Onisim Pyetushkov moaned again Onisim for proprietys
sake was silent for a little while

And another thing he began again shes no feeling of gratitude
whatever Any other girl wouldnt know how to do enough to please you
while she  she doesnt even think of you Why its simply a
disgrace Why the things people are saying about you one cannot repeat
them they positively cry shame on me If I could have known beforehand
Id have

Oh go away do devil shrieked Pyetushkov not stirring from his
place however nor raising his head

Ivan Afanasiitch for mercys sake pursued the ruthless Onisim Im
speaking for your good Despise her Ivan Afanasiitch you simply break
it off Listen to me or else Ill fetch a wise woman shell break the
spell in no time Youll laugh at it yourself later on youll say to
me Onisim why its marvellous how such things happen sometimes You
just consider yourself girls like her theyre like dogs  youve
only to whistle to them

Like one frantic Pyetushkov jumped up from the sofa  but to the
amazement of Onisim who was already lifting both hands to the level of
his cheeks he sat down again as though some one had cut away his legs
from under him Tears were rolling down his pale face a tuft of hair
stood up straight on the top of his head his eyes looked dimmed  his
drawn lips were quivering  his head sank on his breast

Onisim looked at Pyetushkov and plumped heavily down on his knees

Dear master Ivan Afanasiitch he cried your honour Be pleased to
punish me Im a fool Ive troubled you Ivan Afanasiitch How did I
dare Be pleased to punish me your honour Its not worth your while
to weep over my silly words  dear master Ivan Afanasiitch

But Pyetushkov did not even look at his servant he turned away and
buried himself in the corner of the sofa again

Onisim got up went up to his master stood over him and twice he
tugged at his own hair

Wouldnt you like to undress sir  you should go to bed  you
should take some raspberry tea  dont grieve please your honour
Its only half a trouble its all nothing  itll be all right in the
end he said to him every two minutes

But Pyetushkov did not get up from the sofa and only twitched his
shoulders now and then and drew up his knees to his stomach

Onisim did not leave his side all night Towards morning Pyetushkov fell
asleep but he did not sleep long At seven oclock he got up from the
sofa pale dishevelled and exhausted and asked for tea

Onisim with amazing eagerness and speed brought the samovar

Ivan Afanasiitch he began at last in a timid voice your honour is
not angry with me

Why should I be angry with you Onisim answered poor Pyetushkov You
were perfectly right yesterday and I quite agreed with you in
everything

I only spoke through my devotion to you Ivan Afanasiitch

I know that

Pyetushkov was silent and hung his head

Onisim saw that things were in a bad way

Ivan Afanasiitch he said suddenly

Well

Would you like me to fetch Vassilissa here

Pyetushkov flushed red

No Onisim I dont wish it Yes indeed as if she would come he
thought to himself One must be firm It is all nonsense Yesterday
I  Its a disgrace You are right One must cut it all short once for
all as they say Isnt that true

Its the gospel truth your honour speaks Ivan Afanasiitch

Pyetushkov sank again into reverie He wondered at himself he did not
seem to know himself He sat without stirring and stared at the floor
Thoughts whirled round within him like smoke or fog while his heart
felt empty and heavy at once

But whats the meaning of it after all he thought sometimes and
again he grew calmer Its nonsense silliness he said aloud and
passed his hand over his face shook himself and his hand dropped again
on his knee his eyes again rested on the floor

Intently and mournfully Onisim kept watch on his master

Pyetushkov lifted his head

Tell me Onisim he began is it true are there really such
witches spells

There are to be sure there are answered Onisim as he thrust one
foot forward Does your honour know the noncommissioned officer
Krupovaty  His brother was ruined by witchcraft He was bewitched
to love an old woman a cook if your honour only can explain that They
gave him nothing but a morsel of rye bread with a muttered spell of
course And Krupovatys brother simply lost his heart to the cook he
fairly ran after the cook he positively adored hercouldnt keep his
eyes off her She might tell him to do anything hed obey her on the
spot Shed even make a joke of him before other people before
strangers Well she drove him into a decline at last And so it was
Krupovatys brother died And you know she was a cook and an old woman
too very old Onisim took a pinch of snuff Confound the lot of them
these girls and womenfolk

She doesnt care for me a bit thats clear at last thats beyond all
doubt at last Pyetushkov muttered in an undertone gesticulating with
his head and hands as though he were explaining to a perfectly
extraneous person some perfectly extraneous fact

Yes Onisim resumed there are women like that

There are listlessly repeated Pyetushkov in a tone half questioning
half perplexed

Onisim looked intently at his master

Ivan Afanasiitch he began wouldnt you have a snack of something

Wouldnt I have a snack of something repeated Pyetushkov

Or may be youd like to have a pipe

To have a pipe repeated Pyetushkov

So this is what its coming to muttered Onisim Its gone deep
it seems




VIII


The creak of boots resounded in the passage and then there was heard
the usual suppressed cough which announces the presence of a person
of subordinate position Onisim went out and promptly came back
accompanied by a diminutive soldier with a little old womans face
in a patched cloak yellow with age and wearing neither breeches nor
cravat Pyetushkov was startled while the soldier drew himself up
wished him good day and handed him a large envelope bearing the
government seal In this envelope was a note from the major in
command of the garrison he called upon Pyetushkov to come to him
without fail or delay

Pyetushkov turned the note over in his hands and could not refrain from
asking the messenger did he know why the major desired his presence
though he was very well aware of the utter futility of his question

We cannot tell the soldier cried with great effort yet hardly
audibly as though he were half asleep

Isnt he summoning the other officers Pyetushkov pursued

We cannot tell the soldier cried a second time in just the
same voice

All right you can go pronounced Pyetushkov

The soldier wheeled round to the left scraping his foot as he did so
and slapping himself below the spine this was considered smart in the
twenties withdrew

Pyetushkov exchanged glances with Onisim who at once assumed a look of
anxiety Without a word Ivan Afanasiitch set off to the majors

The major was a man of sixty corpulent and clumsily built with a red
and bloated face a short neck and a continual trembling in his
fingers resulting from excessive indulgence in strong drink He
belonged to the class of socalled bourbons thats to say soldiers
risen from the ranks had learned to read at thirty and spoke with
difficulty partly from shortness of breath partly from inability to
follow his own thought His temperament exhibited all the varieties
known to science in the morning before drinking he was melancholy in
the middle of the day choleric and in the evening phlegmatic that is
to say he did nothing at that time but snore and grunt till he was put
to bed Ivan Afanasiitch appeared before him during the choleric period
He found him sitting on a sofa in an open dressinggown with a pipe
between his teeth A fat cropeared cat had taken up her position
beside him

Aha hes come growled the major casting a sidelong glance out of
his pewtery eyes upon Pyetushkov and not stirring from his place Sit
down Well Im going to give you a talking to Ive wanted to get hold
of you this long while

Pyetushkov sank into a chair

For the major began with an unexpected lurch of his whole body
youre an officer dye see and so youve got to behave yourself
according to rule If youd been a soldier Id have flogged you and
thats all about it but as tis youre an officer Did any one ever
see the like of it Disgracing yourselfis that a nice thing

Allow me to know to what these remarks may refer Pyetushkov was
beginning

Ill have no arguing I dislike that beyond everything Ive said I
dislike it and thats all about it Ughwhy your hooks are not in
good form evenwhat a disgrace He sits day in and day out at the
bakers shop and he a gentleman born Theres a petticoat to be found
thereand so there he sits Let her go to the devil the petticoat
Why they do say he puts the bread in the oven Its a stain on the
uniform  so it is

Allow me to submit articulated Pyetushkov with a cold chill at his
heart that all this as far as I can make out refers to my private
life so to say

No arguing with me I tell you Private life he protests too If it
had been a matter of the service Id have sent you straight to the
guardroom Alley marsheer Because of the oath Why there was a whole
birch copse maybe used upon my back so I should think I know the
service every rule of discipline Im very well up in And Id have you
to understand I say this just for the honour of the uniform Youre
disgracing the uniform  so you are I say this like a father  yes
Because all thats put in my charge Ive to answer for it And you dare
to argue too the major shrieked with sudden fury and his face turned
purple and he foamed at the mouth while the cat put its tail in the
air and jumped down to the ground Why do you know  why do you
know what I can do  I can do anything anything anything Why do
you know whom youre talking to Your superior officer gives you orders
and you argue Your superior officer  your superior officer

Here the major positively choked and spluttered while poor Pyetushkov
could only draw himself up and turn pale sitting on the very edge of
his chair

I must have  the major continued with an imperious wave of his
trembling hand I must have everything  up to the mark Conduct
firstclass Im not going to put up with any irregularities You can
make friends with whom you like that makes no odds to me But if you
are a gentleman why act as such  behave like one No putting bread
in the oven for me No calling a draggletail old woman auntie No
disgracing the uniform Silence No arguing

The majors voice broke He took breath and turning towards the door
into the passage bawled Frolka you scoundrel The herrings

Pyetushkov rose hurriedly and darted away almost upsetting the
pageboy who ran to meet him carrying some sliced herring and a stout
decanter of spirits on an iron tray

Silence No arguing sounded after Pyetushkov the disjointed
exclamations of his exasperated superior officer




IX


A queer sensation overmastered Ivan Afanasiitch when at last he found
himself in the street

Why am I walking as it were in a dream he thought to himself Am I
out of my mind or what Why it passes all belief at last Come damn
it shes tired of me come and Ive grown tired of her come and 
What is there out of the way in that

Pyetushkov frowned

I must put an end to it once for all he said almost aloud Ill go
and speak out decisively for the last time so that it may never come
up again

Pyetushkov made his way with rapid step to the bakers shop The nephew
of the hired man Luka a little boy friend and confidant of the goat
that lived in the yard darted swiftly to the little gate directly he
caught sight of Ivan Afanasiitch in the distance

Praskovia Ivanovna came out to meet Pyetushkov

Is your niece at home asked Pyetushkov

No sir

Pyetushkov was inwardly relieved at Vassilissas absence

I came to have a few words with you Praskovia Ivanovna

What about my good sir

Ill tell you You comprehend that after all  that has passed 
after such so to say behaviour Pyetushkov was a little confused 
in a word  But pray dont be angry with me though

Certainly not sir

On the contrary enter into my position Praskovia Ivanovna

Certainly sir

Youre a reasonable woman youll understand of yourself that  that
I cant go on coming to see you any more

Certainly sir Praskovia Ivanovna repeated slowly

I assure you I greatly regret it I confess it is positively painful to
me genuinely painful 

You know best sir Praskovia Ivanovna rejoined serenely Its for
you to decide sir And oh if youll allow me Ill give you your
little account sir

Pyetushkov had not at all anticipated such a prompt acquiescence He had
not desired acquiescence at all he had only wanted to frighten
Praskovia Ivanovna and above all Vassilissa He felt wretched

I know he began this will not be disagreeable to Vassilissa on the
contrary I believe she will be glad

Praskovia Ivanovna got out her reckoning beads and began rattling
the counters

On the other hand continued Pyetushkov growing more and more
agitated if Vassilissa were for instance to give an explanation of
her behaviour  possibly Though of course  I dont know
possibly I might perceive that after all there was no great matter for
blame in it

Theres thirtyseven roubles and forty kopecks in notes to your
account sir observed Praskovia Ivanovna Here would you be pleased
to go through it

Ivan Afanasiitch made no reply

Eighteen dinners at seventy kopecks each twelve roubles sixty
kopecks

And so we are to part Praskovia Ivanovna

If so it must be sir Things do turn out so Twelve samovars at ten
kopecks each 

But you might just tell me Praskovia Ivanovna where it was Vassilissa
went and what it was she 

Oh I never asked her sir One rouble twenty kopecks in silver

Ivan Afanasiitch sank into meditation

Kvas and effervescing drinks pursued Praskovia Ivanovna holding the
counters apart on the frame not with her first but her third finger
half a rouble in silver Sugar and rolls for tea half a rouble Four
packets of tobacco bought by your orders eighty kopecks in silver To
the tailor Kuprian Apollonov 

Ivan Afanasiitch suddenly raised his head put out his hand and mixed up
the counters

What are you about my good man cried Praskovia Ivanovna Dont you
trust me

Praskovia Ivanovna replied Pyetushkov with a hurried smile Ive
thought better of it I was only you know  joking Wed better
remain friends and go on in the old way What nonsense it is How can we
separatetell me that please

Praskovia Ivanovna looked down and made him no reply

Come weve been talking nonsense and theres an end of it pursued
Ivan Afanasiitch walking up and down the room rubbing his hands
and as it were resuming his ancient rights Amen and now Id
better have a pipe

Praskovia Ivanovna still did not move from her place

I see you are angry with me said Pyetushkov

Ive offended you perhaps Well well forgive me generously

How could you offend me my good sir No offence about it Only
please sir added Praskovia Ivanovna bowing be so good as not to go
on coming to us

What

Its not for you sir to be friends with us your honour So please
do us the favour 

Praskovia Ivanovna went on bowing

What ever for muttered the astounded Pyetushkov

Oh nothing sir For mercys sake 

No Praskovia Ivanovna you must explain this 

Vassilissa asks you She says I thank you thank you very much and
from my heart only for the future your honour give us up

Praskovia Ivanovna bowed down almost to Pyetushkovs feet

Vassilissa you say begs me not to come

Just so your honour When your honour came in today and said what
you did that you didnt wish you said to visit us any more I felt
relieved sir that I did thinks I Well thank God how nicely its
all come about But for that I should have had hard work to bring my
tongue to say it Be so good sir

Pyetushkov turned red and pale almost at the same instant Praskovia
Ivanovna still went on bowing

Very good Ivan Afanasiitch cried sharply Goodbye

He turned abruptly and put on his cap

But the little bill sir

Send it  my orderly shall pay you

Pyetushkov went with resolute steps out of the bakers shop and did not
even look round




X


A fortnight passed At first Pyetushkov bore up in an extraordinary way
He went out and visited his comrades with the exception of course of
Bublitsyn but in spite of the exaggerated approbation of Onisim he
almost went out of his mind at last from wretchedness jealousy and
ennui Conversations with Onisim about Vassilissa were the only thing
that afforded him some consolation The conversation was always begun
scratched up by Pyetushkov Onisim responded unwillingly

Its a strange thing you know Ivan Afanasiitch would say for
instance as he lay on the sofa while Onisim stood in his usual
attitude leaning against the door with his hands folded behind his
back when you come to think of it what it was I saw in that girl One
would say that there was nothing unusual in her Its true she has a
good heart That one cant deny her

Good heart indeed Onisim would answer with displeasure

Come now Onisim Pyetushkov went on one must tell the truth Its
a thing of the past now its no matter to me now but justice is
justice You dont know her Shes very goodhearted Not a single
beggar does she let pass by shell always give if its only a crust of
bread Oh And shes of a cheerful temper that one must allow too

What a notion I dont know where you see the cheerful temper

I tell you  you dont know her And shes not mercenary either 
thats another thing Shes not grasping theres no doubt of it Why I
never gave her anything as you know

Thats why shes flung you over

No thats not why responded Pyetushkov with a sigh

Why youre in love with her to this day Onisim retorted malignantly
Youd be glad to go back there as before

Thats nonsense youre talking No my lad you dont know me either I
can see Be sent away and then go dancing attendanceno thank you
Id rather be excused No I tell you You may believe me its all a
thing of the past now

Pray God it be so

But why ever shouldnt I be fair to her now after all If now I say
shes not goodlookingwhy whod believe me

A queer sort of good looks

Well find mewell mention anybody betterlooking 

Oh youd better go back to her then 

Stupid Do you suppose thats why I say so Understand me 

Oh I understand you Onisim answered with a heavy sigh

Another week passed by Pyetushkov had positively given up talking with
his Onisim and had given up going out From morning till night he lay
on the sofa his hands behind his head He began to get thin and pale
eat unwillingly and hurriedly and did not smoke at all Onisim could
only shake his head as he looked at him

Youre not well Ivan Afanasiitch he said to him more than once

No Im all right replied Pyetushkov

At last one fine day Onisim was not at home Pyetushkov got up
rummaged in his chest of drawers put on his cloak though the sun was
rather hot went stealthily out into the street and came back a quarter
of an hour later He carried something under his cloak

Onisim was not at home The whole morning he had been sitting in his
little room deliberating with himself grumbling and swearing between
his teeth and at last he sallied off to Vassilissa He found her in
the shop Praskovia Ivanovna was asleep on the stove rhythmically and
soothingly snoring

Ah how dye do Onisim Sergeitch began Vassilissa with a smile
why havent we seen anything of you for so long

Good day

Why are you so depressed Would you like a cup of tea

Its not me were talking about now rejoined Onisim in a tone
of vexation

Why what then

What Dont you understand me What What have you done to my master
come you tell me that

What Ive done to him

What have you done to him  You go and look at him Why before we
can look round hell be in a decline or dying outright maybe

Its not my fault Onisim Sergeitch

Not your fault God knows Why hes lost his heart to you And you
God forgive you treated him as if he were one of yourselves Dont
come says you Im sick of you Why though hes not much to boast of
hes a gentleman anyway Hes a gentleman born you know Do you
realise that

But hes such a dull person Onisim Sergeitch

Dull So you must have merry fellows about you

And its not so much that hes dull hes so cross so jealous

Ah you youre as haughty as a princess He was in your way I
dare say

But you yourself Onisim Sergeitch if you remember were put out with
him about it Why is he such friends you said whats he always
coming for

Well was I to be pleased with him for it do you suppose

Well then why are you angry with me now Here hes given up coming

Onisim positively stamped

But what am I to do with him if hes such a madman he added
dropping his voice

But how am I in fault What can I do

Ill tell you what come with me to him

God forbid

Why wont you come

But why should I go to see him Upon my word

Why Why because he says youve a good heart let me see if youve a
good heart

But what good can I do him

Oh thats my business You may be sure things are in a bad way since
Ive come to you Its certain I could think of nothing else to do

Onisim paused for a while

Well come along Vassilissa please come along

Oh Onisim Sergeitch I dont want to be friendly with him again 

Well and you needntwhos talking of it Youve only to say a
couple of words to say Why does your honour grieve  give over
Thats all

Really Onisim Sergeitch 

Why am I to go down on my knees to you eh All rightthere Im on
my knees 

But really 

Why what a girl it is Even that doesnt touch her 

Vassilissa at last consented put a kerchief on her head and went out
with Onisim

You wait here a little in the passage he said to her when they
reached Pyetushkovs abode and Ill go and let the master know 

He went in to Ivan Afanasiitch Pyetushkov was standing in the middle of
the room both hands in his pockets his legs excessively wide apart he
was slightly swaying backwards and forwards His face was hot and his
eyes were sparkling

Hullo Onisim he faltered amiably articulating the consonants very
indistinctly and thickly hullo my lad Ah my lad when you werent
here  he he he  Pyetushkov laughed and made a sudden duck
forward with his nose Yes its an accomplished fact he he he
However he added trying to assume a dignified air Im all right
He tried to lift his foot but almost fell over and to preserve his
dignity pronounced in a deep bass Boy bring my pipe

Onisim gazed in astonishment at his master glanced round In the
window stood an empty darkgreen bottle with the inscription Best
Jamaica rum

Ive been drinking my lad thats all Pyetushkov went on Ive
been and taken it Ive been drinking and thats all about it And
whereve you been Tell us  dont be shy  tell us Youre a good
hand at a tale

Ivan Afanasiitch mercy on us wailed Onisim

To be sure To be sure I will replied Pyetushkov with a vague wave of
his hand Ill have mercy on you and forgive you I forgive every one
I forgive you and Vassilissa I forgive and every one every one Yes
my lad Ive been drinking Driinking lad Whos that he
cried suddenly pointing to the door into the passage whos there

Nobodys there Onisim answered hastily who should be there 
where are you going

No no repeated Pyetushkov breaking away from Onisim let me go I
sawdont you talk to meI saw there let me go Vassilissa he
shrieked all at once

Pyetushkov turned pale

Well  well why dont you come in he said at last Come in
Vassilissa come in Im very glad to see you Vassilissa

Vassilissa glanced at Onisim and came into the room Pyetushkov went
nearer to her He heaved deep irregular breaths Onisim watched him
Vassilissa stole timid glances at both of them

Sit down Vassilissa Ivan Afanasiitch began again thanks for
coming Excuse my being  what shall I say  not quite fit to be
seen I couldnt foresee couldnt really youll own that yourself
Come sit down see here on the sofa  So  Im expressing myself
all right I think

Vassilissa sat down

Well good day to you Ivan Afanasiitch pursued Come how are you
what have you been doing

Im well thank God Ivan Afanasiitch And you

I as you see A ruined man And ruined by whom By you Vassilissa
But Im not angry with you Only Im a ruined man You ask him He
pointed to Onisim Dont you mind my being drunk Im drunk certainly
only Im a ruined man Thats why Im drunk because Im a ruined man

Lord have mercy on us Ivan Afanasiitch

A ruined man Vassilissa I tell you You may believe me Ive never
deceived you Oh and hows your aunt

Very well Ivan Afanasiitch Thank you

Pyetushkov began swaying violently

But youre not quite well today Ivan Afanasiitch You ought to
lie down

No Im quite well Vassilissa No dont say Im not well youd
better say Ive fallen into evil ways lost my morals Thats what would
be just I wont dispute that

Ivan Afanasiitch gave a lurch backwards Onisim ran forward and held his
master up

And whos to blame for it Ill tell you if you like whos to blame
Im to blame in the first place What ought I to have said I ought to
have said to you Vassilissa I love you Goodwell will you marry me
Will you Its true youre a working girl granted but thats all
right Its done sometimes Why there I knew a fellow he got married
like that Married a Finnish servantgirl Took and married her And
youd have been happy with me Im a goodnatured chap I am Never you
mind my being drunk you look at my heart There you ask this 
fellow So you see I turn out to be in fault And now of course Im
a ruined man

Ivan Afanasiitch was more and more in need of Onisims support

All the same you did wrong very wrong I loved you I respected
you  whats more Im ready to go to church with you this minute Will
you Youve only to say the word and well start at once Only you
wounded me cruelly  cruelly You might at least have turned me away
yourselfbut through your aunt through that fat female Why the only
joy I had in life was you Im a homeless man you know a poor lonely
creature Who is there now to be kind to me who says a kind word to me
Im utterly alone Stript bare as a crow You ask this  Ivan
Afanasiitch began to cry Vassilissa listen what I say to you he
went on let me come and see you as before Dont be afraid Ill
be  quiet as a mouse You can go and see whom you like Illbe all
right not a word no protests you know Eh do you agree If you like
Ill go down on my knees And Ivan Afanasiitch bent his knees but
Onisim held him up under the arms Let me go Its not your business
Its a matter of the happiness of a whole life dont you understand
and you hinder

Vassilissa did not know what to say

You wont  Well as you will God be with you In that case goodbye
Goodbye Vassilissa I wish you all happiness and prosperity  but
I  but I 

And Pyetushkov sobbed violently Onisim with all his might held him up
from behind  first his face worked then he burst out crying And
Vassilissa cried too




XI


Ten years later one might have met in the streets of the little town of
O a thinnish man with a reddish nose dressed in an old green coat
with a greasy plush collar He occupied a small garret in the bakers
shop with which we are familiar Praskovia Ivanovna was no longer of
this world The business was carried on by her niece Vassilissa and
her husband the redhaired dimeyed baker Demofont The man in the
green coat had one weakness he was over fond of drink He was however
always quiet when he was tipsy The reader has probably recognised him
as Ivan Afanasiitch
