PREFACE

FOR THE OTHER AMERICANS

I have written this account only secondarily and at the instigation of
publishers for Americans Primarily I wrote it for the English people
I composed it in their country it was suggested by their institutions
and it is addressed to them You will see if you read it that I had
reasons for doing this The reasons are in the first chapter at the
very beginning As you have not far to look for them therefore and as
it is quite unnecessary to print a thing twice in the same book I will
not go over them again The object of this preface is chiefly to
draw your attention to the fact that I am not talking to you dear
compatriot so that you will understand that there is no personal ground
for any annoyance you may feel at what I say

Notwithstanding this one of the Miss Wastgoggles of Boston has
already taken the trouble to send me a rather severely reproachful
letter about my impressions and experiences in which she says that she
would have written hers if it had ever occurred to her to do so very
differently I have no doubt that this is true She also begs me
to remember that there are a great many different kinds of girls in
America numbers of whom are brought up quite as they are in England
It is this remark of hers that makes me quote Miss Wastgoggles I wish
to say in connection with it that while it is unreasonable to apologize
for being only one kind of American girl I do not pretend to represent
the ideas of any more

AN AMERICAN GIRL IN LONDON



I



Original AM an American Girl Therefore perhaps you will not be surprised at anything further I may have to say for myself I have observed since I came to England that this statement made by a third person in connection with any question of my own conduct is always broadly explanatory And as my own conduct will naturally enter more or less into this volume I may as well make it in the beginning to save complications

It may be necessary at this point to explain further I know that in
England an unmarried person of my age is not expected to talk
much especially about herself This was a little difficult for me to
understand at first as I have always talked a great deal and one
might say been encouraged to do it but I have at length been brought
to understand it and lately I have spoken with becoming infrequency
and chiefly about the Zoo I find the Zoo to be a subject which is
almost certain to be received with approval and in animal nature there
is fortunately a good deal of variety I do not intend however in
this book to talk about the Zoo or anything connected with it but
about the general impressions and experiences I have received in your
country and one of my reasons for departing from approved models
of discussion for young ladies and striking out as it were into
subjectmatter on my own account is that I think you may find it more
or less interesting I have noticed that you are pleased over here to
bestow rather more attention upon the American Girl than upon any other
kind of American that we produce You have taken the trouble to form
opinions about herI have heard quantities of them Her behaviour
and her bringingup her idioms and her accentabove all her
accenthave made themes for you and you have been good enough to
discuss themMr James in your midst correcting and modifying your
impressionswith a good deal of animation for you I observe that
she is almost the only frivolous subject that ever gets into your
newspapers I have become accustomed to meeting her there usually at
the breakfasttable dressed in green satin and diamonds The encounter
had quite a shock of novelty for me at first but that wore off in time
the green satin and diamonds were so invariable

Being an American girl myself I do not naturally quite see the reason
of this and it is a matter I feel a delicacy about inquiring into on
personal grounds Privately I should think that the number of us that
come over here every summer to see the Tower of London and the National
Gallery and visit StratforduponAvon to say nothing of those who
marry and stay in England would have made you familiar with the kind
of young women we are long ago and to me it is very curious that you
should go on talking about us I cant say that we object very much
because while you criticise us considerably as a class you are very
polite to us individually and nobody minds being criticised as a noun
of multitude But it has occurred to me that since so much is to be
said about the American Girl it might be permissible for her to say
some of it herself

Original I have learned that in England you like to know a great deal about people who are introduced to youwho their fathers and mothers are their grandfathers and grandmothers and even further back than that

So I will gratify you at once on this point so far as I am able My
father is Mr Joshua P Wick of Chicago Illyou may have seen his
name in connection with the bakingpowder interest in that city That is
how he made his fortunein bakingpowder as he has often said it is
to bakingpowder that we owe everything He began by putting it up
in small quantities but it is an article that is so much used in the
United States and ours was such a very good kind that the demand for
it increased like anything and though we have not become so rich as a
great many people in America it is years since poppa gave his personal
superintendence to the business You will excuse my spelling it poppa
I have called him that all my life and papa doesnt seem to mean
anything to me

Lately he has devoted himself to politics he is in Congress now and
at the next election momma particularly wishes him to run for senator
There is a great deal of compliance about poppa and I think he will
run

Momma was a Miss Wastgaggle of Boston and she was teaching school in
Chicago when poppa met her Her grandfather who educated her was a
manufacturer of glass eyes There are Wastgaggles in Boston now but
they spell the name with one g and lately they have been wanting
momma to write hers Mrs WastgagleWick but momma says that since she
never liked the name well enough to give it to any of her children she
is certainly not going to take it again herself These Wastgagles speak
of our greatgrandfather as a wellknown oculist and I suppose in a
sense he was one

My fathers father lived in England and was also a manufacturer poppa
says always adding in a plain way so I suppose whatever he made
he made himself It may have been boots or umbrellas or pastrypoppa
never states though I should be disposed to think from his taking up
the bakingpowder idea that it was pastry

I am sorry that I am not able to give you fuller satisfaction about my
antecedents I know that I must have had more than I have mentioned but
my efforts to discover themand I have made efforts since I decided
to introduce myself to youhave been entirely futile I am inclined to
think that they were not people who achieved any great distinction in
life but I have never held anything against them on that account for I
have no reason to believe that they would not have been distinguished
if they could I cannot think that it has ever been in the nature of the
Wicks or the Wastgaggles either to let the opportunity for distinction
pass through any criminal negligence on their part I am perfectly
willing to excuse them on this ground therefore and if I who am most
intimately concerned in the matter can afford to do this perhaps it is
not unreasonable to expect it of you

In connections we do better A grandaunt of some early Wastgaggles was
burned as a witch in Salem Massa thing very few families can point
back to even in England I should think and a second cousin of
mommas was the first wife of one of our Presidents He was a Democratic
President though and as poppa always votes the Republican ticket
we dont think much of that Besides as we are careful to point out
whenever we mention the subject she was in the cemetery years before
he was in the White House And there is Mrs Portheris of HalfMoon
Street Hyde Park who is poppas aunt by her first marriage

We were all coming at first poppa and momma and Ithe others are
still in schooland it had appeared among the City Personals of the
Chicago Tribune that Colonel and Mrs Joshua P Wick accompanied
by Miss Mamie WickI forgot to say that poppa was in the Civil
Warwould have a look at monarchical institutions this summer Our
newspapers do get hold of things so But just a week before we were
to sail something aroseI think it was a political complicationto
prevent poppas going and momma is far too much of an invalid to
undertake such a journey without him I must say that both my parents
are devoted to me and when I said I thought Id prefer going alone to
giving up the trip neither of them opposed it Momma said she thought
I ought to have the experience because though Id been a good deal in
society in Chicago she didnt consider that that in itself was enough
Poppa said that the journey was really nothing nowadays and he could
easily get me a letter of introduction to the captain Besides in a
shipful of two or three hundred there would be sure to be some pleasant
people I could get acquainted with on the voyage Mrs Von Stuvdidyl
who lives next door to us and has been to Europe several times
suggested that I should take a maid and momma rather liked the idea
but I persuaded her out of it I couldnt possibly have undertaken the
care of a maid

And then we all thought of Mrs Portheris

None of us had ever seen her and there had been very little
correspondence in fact we had not had a letter from her since several
years ago when she wrote a long one to poppa something about some
depressed California mining stock I believe which she thought poppa
as her nephew and an American ought to take off her hands before it
fell any lower And I remember that poppa obliged her whether as an
American or as her nephew I dont know After that she sent us every
year a Christmas card with an angel or a bunch of forgetmenots on it
inscribed To my nephew and niece Joshua Peter and Mary Wick and all
their dear ones Her latest offering was lying in the cardbasket on
the table then and I am afraid we looked at it with more interest than
we had ever done before

The dear ones read so sympathetically that momma said she knew we
could depend upon Mrs Portheris to take me round and make me enjoy
myself and she wanted to cable that I was coming But poppa said No
his aunt must be getting up in years now and an elderly English lady
might easily be frightened into apoplexy by a cablegram It was a pity
there was no time to write but I must just go and see her immediately
and say that I was the daughter of Joshua P Wick of Chicago and she
would be certain to make me feel at home at once But as I said none
of us knew Mrs Portheris





II

I AM not much acquainted in New York so I had only poppa and Mr
Winterhazel to see me off Mr Winterhazel lives there and does
business in Wall Street where he operates very successfully Ive been
told for such a young man We had been the greatest friends and regular
correspondents for three or four yearsour tastes in literature and art
were almost exactly the same and it was a mutual pleasure to keep it
upbut poppa had never met him before They were very happy to make
each others acquaintance though and became quite intimate at once
they had heard so much about each other they said We had allowed two
days before the steamer sailed so that I could make some purchasesNew
York styles are so different from Chicago ones and as poppa said
afterwards it was very fortunate that Mr Winterhazel was there
Otherwise I should have been obliged to go round to the stores alone
for poppa himself was so busy seeing people about political matters that
he hadnt the thirtieth part of a second for me except at mealtimes
and then there was almost always somebody there London is nothing to
New York for confusion and hurry and until you get accustomed to it the
Elevated is apt to be very trying to your nerves But Mr Winterhazel
was extremely kind and gave up his whole time to me and as he knew all
the best stores this put me under the greatest obligation to him
After dinner the first evening he took me to hear a gentleman who
was lecturing on the London of Charles Dickens with a stereopticon
thinking that as I was going to London it would probably be of
interest to meand it was I anticipated your city more than ever
afterwards Poppa was as disappointed as could be that he wasnt able to
go with us to the lecture but he said that politics were politics and
I suppose they are

Next day I sailed from North River Docks Pier No  a fresh wind
blowing all the harbour into short blue waves with the sun on them
and poppa and Mr Winterhazel taking off their hats and waving their
handkerchiefs as long as I could see them I suppose I started for Great
Britain with about as many comforts as most people havepoppa and Mr
Winterhazel had almost filled my stateroom with flowers and I found
four pounds of caramels under the lower berthbut I confess as we
steamed out past Staten Island and I saw the statue of Liberty getting
smaller and smaller and the waves of the Atlantic Ocean getting bigger
and bigger I felt very much by myself indeed and began to depend a
good deal upon Mrs Portheris

As to the caramels in the next three hours I gave the whole of them to
the first stewardess who was kind enough to oblige me with a lemon

Before leaving home I had promised everybody that I would keep a diary
and most of the time I did but I find nothing at all of interest in it
about the first three days of the voyage to London The reason was that
I had no opportunity whatever of making observations But on the morning
of the fourth day I was obliged to go on deck The stewardess said
she couldnt put up with it any longer and I would never recover if I
didnt and I was very glad afterwards that I gave in She was a real
kindhearted stewardess I may say though her manner was a little
peremptory

I didnt find as much sociability on deck as I expected I should have
thought everybody would have been more or less acquainted by that time
but with the exception of a few gentlemen people were standing or
sitting round in the same little knots they came on board in And yet
it was very smooth I was so perfectly delighted to be well again that
I felt I must talk to somebody so I spoke to one of a party of ladies
from Boston who I thought might know the Wastgagles there I was very
polite and she did not seem at all seasick but I found it difficult
to open up a conversation with her I knew that the Bostonians thought
a good deal of themselvesall the Wastgagles doand her manner somehow
made me think of a story I once heard of a Massachusetts milestone
marked  m from Boston which somebody thought was a wayside tablet
with the simple pathetic epitaph Im from Boston on it and just to
enliven her I told her the story Indeed she said Well we are from
Boston

I didnt quite know what to do after that for the only other lady near
me was English I knew by her boots Beside the boots she had grey hair
and pink cheeks and rather sharp grey eyes and a large oldfashioned
muff and a red cloud Only an Englishwoman would be wearing a muff and
a cloud like that in publicnobody else would dare to do it She was
rather portly and she sat very firmly and comfortably in her chair
with her feet crossed done up in a big Scotch rug and being an English
woman I knew that she would not expect anybody to speak to her who had
not been introduced She would probably I thought give me a haughty
stare as they do in novels and say with cold repression You have
the advantage of me missand then what would my feelings be So I
made no more advances to anybody but walked off my high spirits on the
hurricanedeck thinking about the exclusiveness of those Bostonians
and wondering whether as a nation we could be catching it from
England

You may imagine my feelingsor rather as you are probably English
you cantwhen the head steward gave me my place at the dinnertable
immediately opposite the Bostonians and between this lady and an
unknown gentleman I shall not make a single travelling acquaintance
I said to myself as I sat downand I must say I was disappointed I
began to realise how greatly we had all unconsciously depended upon my
forming nice travelling acquaintances as people always do in books to
make the trip pleasant and I thought that in considering another voyage
I should divorce myself from that idea beforehand However I said
nothing of course and found a certain amount of comfort in my soup

I remember the courses of that dinner very well and if they were
calculated to make interesting literary matter I could write them out
The Bostonians ostentatiously occupied themselves with one another One
of them took up a position several miles behind her spectacles looked
at me through them and then said something to her neighbour about
Daisy Miller which the neighbour agreed to I know what they meant
now The gentleman when he was not attending to his dinner stared at
the saltcellar most of the time in a blank abstracted way and the
English lady who looked much nicer unshelled than she did on deck kept
her head carefully turned in the other direction and made occasional
remarks to an elderly person next her who was very deaf If I had not
been hungry I dont know how I should have felt But I maintained an
absolute silence and ate my dinner

Graduallyperhaps because the elderly person was so extremely deaf and
my own behaviour comparatively unaggressivethe lady of England began
to assume a less uncomfortable position A certain repellent air went
out of her right shoulder Presently she sat quite parallel with the
table By the advent of the puddingit was cabinet puddingI had
become conscious that she had looked at me casually three times When
the Gorgonzola appeared I refused it In America ladies eat very little
Gorgonzola

Dont you like cheese she said suddenly a little as if I had
offended her I was so startled that I equivocated somewhat

Nom not to day I thinkthank you I said The fact is I never
touch it

Oh she responded But then this is your first appearance I
suppose In that case you wouldnt like it And I felt forgiven

She said nothing more until dessert and then she startled me again
Have you been bad she inquired

I didnt know quite what to say it seemed such an extraordinary
question but it flashed upon me that perhaps the lady was some kind
of missionary in which case it was my duty to be respectful So I said
that I hoped notthat at least I hadnt been told so since I was a
very little girl But then I said The Episcopalian Prayerbook
says were all miserable sinners doesnt it The lady looked at me in
astonishment

What has the Prayerbook to do with your being ill she exclaimed
Oh I see and she laughed very heartily You thought I meant
naughty Crossquestions and crooked answers Mr Mafferton you will
appreciate this Mr Mafferton was the gentleman whom I have mentioned
in connection with the saltcellars and my other neighbour seemed to
know him which as they both came from England did not surprise me
then although now I should be inclined to consider that the most likely
reason of all why they shouldnt be acquainted I didnt see anything so
very humorous in it but the lady explained our misunderstanding to Mr
Mafferton as if it were the greatest joke imaginable and she had made
it herself Really she said its good enough for Punch I was
unfamiliar with that paper then and couldnt say but now I think it
was myself

Mr Mafferton coloured dreadfullyI omitted to say that he was a
youngish gentlemanand listened with a sort of strained smile which
debouched into a hesitating and uncomfortable remark about curious
differences in idioms I thought he intended it to be polite and he
said it in the most agreeable mans voice I had ever heard but I could
not imagine what there was to flurry him so and I felt quite sorry for
him And he had hardly time to get safely back to the saltcellar before
we all got up

Next morning at breakfast I got on beautifully with the English lady
who hardly talked to the elderly deaf person at all but was kind enough
to be very much interested in what I expected to see in London Your
friends will have their hands full she remarked with a sort of kind
acerbity if they undertake to show you all that I thought of
poor old Mrs Portheris who was probably a martyr to rheumatism and
neuralgia with some compunction Oh I said I shouldnt think of
asking them to Ill read it all up and then I can go round beautifully
by myself

By yourself she exclaimed You This is an independent American
young ladythe very person I went especially to the United States to
see and spent a whole season in New York going everywhere without
coming across a single specimen You must excuse my staring at you But
youll have to get over that idea Your friends will never in the world
allow itI suppose you have friends

No I said only a relation

The lady laughed Do you intend that for a joke she asked Well
they do mean different things sometimes But well see what the relation
will have to say to it

Mr Mafferton occasionally removed his eyes from the saltcellar during
this meal and even ventured a remark or two The remarks were not
striking in any waythere was no food for thought in them whatever yet
they were very agreeable Whether it was Mr Maffertons voice or his
manner or his almost apologetic way of speaking as if he knew that he
was not properly acquainted and ought not to do it I dont know but
I liked hearing him make them It was not however until later in the
day when I was sitting on deck talking with the lady from England about
New York where she didnt seem to like anything but the air and the
melons that I felt the least bit acquainted with Mr Mafferton I had
found out her name by the way She asked me mine and when I told her
she said But youre old enough now to have a Christian namewerent
you christened Mary She went on to say that she believed in the
good oldfashioned names like Nancy and Betsy that couldnt be
babifiedand I am not sure whether she told me or it was by intuition
that I learned that hers was Hephzibah It seems to me now that it never
could have been anything else But I am quite certain she added that her
husband was Hector Torquilin and that he had been dead fifteen years
A distinguished man in his time my dear as you would know if you had
been brought up in an English schoolroom And just then while I was
wondering what would be the most appropriate thing to say to a lady
who told you that her husband had been dead fifteen years and was a
distinguished man in his time and wishing that I had been brought up
in an English schoolroom so that I could be polite about him Mr
Mafferton came up He had one of Mr W D Howells novels in his
hand and at once we glided into the subject of American literature I
remember I was surprised to find an Englishman so goodnatured in his
admiration of some of our authors and so willing to concede an American
standard which might be a high one and yet have nothing to do with
Dickens and so appreciative generally of the conditions which have
brought about our ways of thinking and writing We had a most delightful
conversationI had no idea there was so much in Mr Maffertonand Mrs
Torquilin only interrupted once That was to ask us if either of us had
ever read the works of Fennimore Cooper who was about the only author
America had ever produced Neither of us had and I said I thought there
were some others Well she said he is the only one we ever hear of
in England But I dont think Mrs Torquilin was quite correct in this
statement because since I have been in England I have met three or
four people beside Mr Mafferton who knew or at least had heard of
several American writers Then Mrs Torquilin went to sleep and when
she woke up it was five oclock and her maid was just arriving with
her tea Mr Mafferton asked me if he might get me some but I said No
thanks I thought I would take a brisk walk instead if Mrs Torquilin
would excuse me

Certainly she said go and take some exercise both of you Its
much better for young people than teadrinking And see here my dear I
thought you were very sensible not to dress for dinner last night like
those silly young fools opposite Silly young fools I call them Now
take my advice and dont let them persuade you to do it An Atlantic
steamer is no place for bare arms Now run away and have your walk and
Mr Mafferton will see that youre not blown overboard

Mr Mafferton hesitated a moment Are you quite sure he said that
you wouldnt prefer the tea

Oh yes sir I said we always have tea at halfpast six at home and
I dont care about it so early as this Id much rather walk But dont
trouble to come with me if you would like some tea

Ill come he said if you wont call me sir Here he frowned a
little and coloured It makes one feel seventy you know May I ask why
you do it

I explained that in Chicago it was considered polite to say maam or
sir to a lady or gentleman of any age with whom you did not happen to
be very well acquainted and I had heard it all my life still if he
objected to it I would not use it in his case

He said he thought he did object to itfrom a lady it had other
associations in his ears

So I stopped calling Mr Mafferton sir and since then except to
very old gentlemen I have got out of the way of using the expression
I asked him if there was anything else that struck him as odd in my
conversation kindly to tell me as of course I did not wish to be an
unnecessary shock to my relation in HalfMoon Street He did not say he
would but we seemed to get on together even more agreeably after that

Mr Mafferton appeared to know nobody on board but Mrs Torquilin and
I made acquaintance with hardly anybody else so that we naturally saw a
good deal of each other usually in the afternoons walking up and down
the deck He lent me all his books and I lent him all mine and we
exchanged opinions on a great variety of subjects When we argued he
was always very polite and considerate but I noticed one curious thing
about himI never could bring him round to my point of view He did not
seem to see the necessity of coming although I often went round to
his This was a new experience to me in arguing with a gentleman And
he always talked very impersonally At first this struck me as a little
cold and uninterested but afterwards I liked it It was like drinking
a very nice kind of pure cold waterafter the different flavours of
personality I had always been accustomed to Mr Mafferton only made
one exception to this rule that I remember and that was the afternoon
before we landed Then he told me particularly about his father and
mother and their tastes and occupation also the names and ages of his
brothers and sisters and their tastes and occupations and where he
lived But I cannot say I found him as interesting that afternoon as
usual

I need not describe the bustle and confusion of landing at Liverpool
Docks in the middle of a wet April afternoon Mrs Torquilin had told me
at breakfast not on any account to let my relations take me away before
she had given me her address but when the time came I guessif you
will allow meshe must have forgotten because the last time I saw her
she was standing under a very big umbrella which the maid held over
her a good deal excited and giving a great many orders about her
luggage to a nervouslooking man in livery

I easily identified mine and got off by train for London without any
trouble to speak of We arrived rather late though and it was still
pouring

What has become of your people asked somebody at my elbow I turned
and saw Mr Mafferton who must have come down by the same train

I didnt expect my relation to meet me said she doesnt expect me

 Oh said Mr Mafferton you did not write to her before you sailed

No I said There wasnt time

Upon my word said Mr Mafferton Then as I suppose I looked rather
surprised he added hastily I only mean that it seems soso
uncommonly extraordinary you know But I would advise you in that
case to give the bulk of your luggage into the hands of the forwarding
agents with instructions to send it early tomorrow to your friends
address It is all you can do tonight said Mr Mafferton really Of
course you will go there immediately yourself

No I responded firmly I think not Mr Mafferton My relation is
very elderly and probably in bad health For all I know she may have
gone to bed I must not disturb her so late All the people I have ever
known have stayed at the Mtropole in London I will go to the Mtropole
for tonight and have my things sent there Tomorrow I will go and see
my relation and if she asks me to visit her I can easily telephone up
for them Thank you very much

Mr Mafferton looked as sober as possible if not a little annoyed
Then he went and got the agents young man and asked me to point out my
things to him which I did and got receipts Then he told a porter to
call a cab and put my smaller valises into it I will put you in he
said and he gave me his arm and his umbrella through the wettest
rain I have ever experienced to the hansom I thanked him again very
cordially and before he said goodbye he very kindly gave me his card
and address and begged me to let him know if there was anything he
could do for me

Then I rattled away through the blurred lights of your interminable
twisted streets to the Mtropole fancying I saw Westminster Abbey or
St Pauls through the rain at every turn

When we stopped at last before the hotel another hansom behind us
stopped too and though I am sure he didnt intend me to I saw quite
plainly through the glassMr Mafferton It was extremely kind of him
to wish to be of assistance to a lady alone especially in such weather
and I could easily understand his desire to see me to my hotel but what
puzzled me was why he should have taken another cab

And all night long I dreamed of Mrs Portheris





III

I ONCE visited the Wastgagles in Boston with momma It was a visit of
condolence just after the demise of a grandmother of theirs I was
going to say that never since that occasion had I experienced anything
like the solemnity of my breakfast at the Mtropole the morning after I
arrived As a sadfaced waiter with muttonchop whiskers marshalled me
across the room to an empty little whiteandsilvery table beside one of
the big windows I felt for the first time in my life that I was being
made imposing and I objected to the feeling The place itself did not
impress me particularlyin America we are accustomed to gorgeousness in
our hotels and the mirrors and the gilding of the Mtropole rather made
me feel at home than otherwise but it was the demeanour of everything
that weighed upon me My very chair lived up to its own standard of
decorum and the table seemed laid upon a pattern of propriety that it
would never willingly depart from There was an allpervading sense of
order in the air I couldnt make out exactly where it came from but it
was there and it was fearful The waiters spoke to each other in low
tones as if something of deep and serious importance were going on
and when I told one of them what I should like from the billoffare he
bent down his ear and received my order as if it had been confidential
State business I was asking him to undertake When he came back
carrying the tray in front of him it was almost processional And in
the interval when I turned round to look out of the window and saw
another of those respectfullysubdued waiters standing behind my chair
quite motionless I jumped A great many people were getting their
breakfasts not with the cheerful alacrity which we use at home but
rather with a portentous deliberation and concentration which did not
admit of much talking The silence was broken only in one corner where
a group of Americans seemed to have got accustomed to the atmosphere
When the English breakfasters raised their eyes from their papers and
eggsandtoast they regarded my talkative compatriots with a look which
must have fairly chilled their tea I hope nobody has ever looked at me
like that in England The Americans were from Virginia as I could tell
by their accent and their cyarnt and sisr and honey and heap
better But I have no doubt the English people in their usual loftily
comprehensive fashion set the strangers down as Yankees and no
amount of explanation could have taught them that the Yankees are
the New Englanders and that the name would once have been taken as an
insult by a Southerner But the Virginians were blissfully indifferent
to the British estimate of themselves and they talked as freely of
their shopping and sightseeing as they would in Delmonicos or the
Brunswick To be perfectly honest a conviction came to me then that
sometimes we dont care enough But for my part I liked listening to
that Virginian corner

Im afraid it was rather a late breakfast and the lobby was full of
people strolling in and out when I went through on my way to my room I
stood for a moment at the diningroom door looking at the lobbyI had
heard so many Chicago people describe itand I noticed in the seats
that run around it against the wall two young women They were leaning
back nonchalantly watching the comers and the goers Both of them had
their knees crossed and one had her hands in her jacket pockets A man
in the seat next them who might or might not have belonged to them was
smoking a large cigar Two English ladies came out from breakfast behind
me stood waiting for somebody and said one to the other Look at
those disgusting American girls

But I had seen the young womens boots Just to be satisfied I walked
up to one of them and asked her if she could kindly tell me when I
ought to post letters for New York

The American maiyel goes out Wednesdays an Satuhdays I fancy the
young woman replied but Im not suah it would be saifah to ask the

She spoke quite distinctly so that the English ladies must have heard
her and I am afraid they saw in my glance as I went upstairs that I had
intended to correct their mistake

I started to see Mrs Portheris at eleven oclock on the morning of the
th of Aprila lovely day a day which augured brightly and hopefully
I waited carefully till eleven thinking by that time my relation would
have had her breakfast in bed and been dressed and perhaps have been
helped downstairs to her own particular sunny window where I thought I
might see her faded placid sweet old face looking up from her knitting
and out into the busy street Words have such an inspiring effect upon
the imagination All this had emanated from the dear ones and I felt
confident and pleased and happy beforehand to be a dear one I wore one
of my plainest walkingdressesI love simplicity in dressso as to
mitigate the shock to my relation as far as I could but it was a
New York one and it gave me a great deal of moral support It may be
weakminded in me but I simply couldnt have gone to see my relation in
a hat and gloves that didnt match Clothes and courage have so much to
do with each other

The porter said that I had better take aansom or if I walked to
Charing Cross I could get a Ammersmith bus which would take me to
HalfMoon Street Piccadilly I asked him if there were any streetcars
running that way Dye mean growlers miss he said I can get ye a
growler in arf a minute But I didnt know what he meant and I didnt
like the sound of it A growler was probably not at all a proper thing
for a young lady to ride in and I was determined to be considerate of
the feelings of my relation I saw ladies in hansoms but I had never
been in one at home and they looked very tiltuppy Also they went
altogether too fast and as it was a slippery day the horses attached
to them sat down and rested a great deal oftener than I thought I should
like And when the animals were not poor old creatures that were obliged
to sit down in this precipitate way they danced and pranced in a manner
which did not inspire me with confidence In America our cabhorses know
themselves to be cabhorses and behave accordinglythey have none of
the national theories about equality whatever but the London quadrupeds
might be the greatest Democrats going from the airs they put on And I
saw no streetcars anywhere So I decided upon the Ammersmith bus and
the porter pointed out the direction of Charing Cross

It seems to me now that I was what you would call uncommonly stupid
about it but I hadnt gone very far before I realised that I did not
quite know what Charing Cross was I had come you see from a city
where the streets are mostly numbered and run pretty much in rows The
more I thought about it the less it seemed to mean anything So I
asked a large policemanthe largest and straightest policeman with
the reddest face I had ever seen Mr Officer I said knowing your
fondness for titles in this country what is Charing Cross

He smiled very kindly Wy miss he said theres Charing Cross
Station and theres Charing Cross Otel and theres Charing Cross Wot
were you wanting pertickeler

Charing Cross said I

There it lies in front of you the policeman said waving his arm so
as to take in the whole of Trafalgar Square It aint possible for
you to miss it Miss And as three other people were waiting to ask
him something else I thought I ought not to occupy his attention any
further I kept straight on in and out among the crowd comparing it
in my mind with a New York or Chicago crowd I found a great many more
kinds of people in it than there would be at home

You are remarkably different in this country We are a good deal the
same I was not at all prepared then to make a comparison of averages
but I noticed that life seemed to mean something more serious for most
of the people I met than it does with us Hardly anybody was laughing
and very few people were making unseemly haste about their business
There was no eagerness and no enthusiasm Neither was there any
hustling In a crowd like that in Chicago everybody would have hustled
and nobody would have minded it

Where is Charing Cross I asked one of the flowerwomen sitting by
the big iron entrances to the station Rightere miss ware you be
astandin Buy a flower miss Only a penny an lovely they are Do
buy one laidy It was dreadfully pathetic the way she said it and
she had frightful holes in her shawl and no hat or bonnet on I had
never seen a woman selling things out of doors with nothing on her head
before and it hurt me somehow But I couldnt possibly have bought
her flowersthey were too much like her So I gave her a sixpence
and asked her where I could find an Ammersmith bus She thanked me so
volubly that I couldnt possibly understand her but I made out that
if I stayed where I was an Ammersmith bus would presently arrive She
went on asking me to buy flowers though so I walked a little farther
off I waited a long time and not a single bus appeared with
Ammersmith on it Finally I asked another policeman There he said
as one of the great lumbering concerns rolled upthats one of em
now Youll get it I didnt like to dispute with an officer of the
law but I had seen plenty of that particular red variety of bus go
past and to be quite certain I said But isnt that a Hammersmith
one The policeman looked quite cross Well isnt that what youre
aaskin for Ammersmith an Ammersmithits all the saime dependin
on ow you pernounces it Some people calls it Ammersmith an some
people calls it Ammersmith and he turned a broad and indignant back
upon me I flew for the bus and the conductor in a friendly way
helped me on by my elbow

I did not think before that anything could wobble like an Atlantic
steamer but I experienced nothing more trying coming over than that
Hammersmith bus And there were no straps from the roof to hold on
bynothing but a very high and inconvenient handrail and the vehicle
seemed quite full of stout old gentlemen with white whiskers who looked
deeply annoyed when I upset their umbrellas and unintentionally plunged
upon their feet More room houtside miss the conductor saidwhich
I considered impertinent thinking that he meant in the road Is there
any room on top I asked him because I had walked on so many of the
old gentlemens feet that I felt uncomfortable about it Yes miss
thats wot Im asayinlots o room houtside So I took advantage of
a lame mans getting off to mount the spiral staircase at the back of
thebus and take a seat on top It is a pity isnt it that Noah didnt
think of an outside spiral staircase like that to his ark He might have
accommodated so many more of the animals providing them of course
with oilskin covers to keep off the wet as you do But even coming from
a bran new and irreverent country where nobody thinks of consulting the
Old Testament for models of public conveyances anybody can see that in
many respects you have improved immensely upon Noah

It was lovely up thereexactly like coming on deck after being in a
stuffy little cabin in the steamera good deal of motion but lots of
fresh air I was a little nervous at first but as nobody fell off the
tops of any of the other buses I concluded that it was not a thing you
were expected to do and presently forgot all about it looking at
the people swarming below me My position made me feel immeasurably
superiorat such a swinging height above them alland I found myself
speculating about them and criticising them as I never should have done
walking I had never ridden on the top of anything before it gave me
an entirely new revelation of my fellowcreaturesif your monarchical
feelings will allow that expression from a Republican I must say I
liked itlooking down upon people who were travelling in the same
direction as I was only on a level below I began to understand
the agreeableness of class distinctions and I wondered whether the
arrangement of seats on the tops of the buses was not probably a
material result of aristocratic prejudices

Oh I liked it through and through that first ride on a London bus To
know just how I liked it and why and how and why we all like it from
the other side of the Atlantic you must be born and brought up as most
of us have been in a city twentyfive or fifty years old where the
houses are all made of clean white or red brick with clean green
lawns and geranium beds and painted iron fences where rows of nice new
mapletrees are planted in the cleanshaved boulevards and freshplaned
wooden sidewalks run straight for a mile or two at a time and all the
city blocks stand in their proper right angleswhich are among our
advantages I have no doubt but our advantages have a way of making
your disadvantages more interesting

Having been monarchists all your lives however you cant possibly
understand what it is to have been brought up in fresh paint I ought
not to expect it of you If you could though I should find it easier
to tell you according to my experience why we are all so devoted to
London

There was the smell to begin with I write there was because I
regret to say that during the past few months I have become accustomed
to it and for me that smell is done up in a past tense for ever
so that I can quite understand a Londoner not believing in it The
Hammersmith bus was in the Strand when I first became conscious of it
and I noticed afterwards that it was always more pronounced down there
in the heart of the City than in Kensington for instance It was no
special odour or collection of odours that could be distinguishedit
was rather an abstract smelland yet it gave a kind of solidity and
nutriment to the air and made you feel as if your lungs digested it
There was comfort and support and satisfaction in that smell and I
often vainly try to smell it again

We find the irregularity of London so gratifying too The way the
streets turn and twist and jostle each other and lead up into nothing
and turn around and come back again and assume aliases and break out
into circuses and stray into queer dark courts where small boys go
round on one roller skate or little green churchyards only a few yards
from the cabs and the crowd where there is nobody but the dead people
who have grown tired of it all

Original From the top of the Hammersmith bus as it went through the Strand that morning I saw funny little openings that made me long to get down and look into them but I had my relation to think of so I didnt

Then there is the wellsettled wellfounded look of everything as if
it had all come ages ago and meant to stay for ever and just go on the
way it had before We like thatthe security and the permanence of it
which seems to be in some way connected with the big policemen and the
orderly crowd and Keep to the Left on the signboards and the British
coat of arms over so many of the shops I thought that morning that
those shops were probably the property of the Crown but I was very soon
corrected about that At home I am afraid we fluctuate considerably
especially in connection with cyclones and railway interestswe are
here today and there is no telling where we shall be tomorrow So the
abiding kind of city gives us a comfortable feeling of confidence It
was not very long before even I on the top of the Hammersmith bus
felt that I was riding an Institution and no matter to what extent it
wobbled it might be relied upon not to come down

I dont know whether you will like our admiring you on account of
your griminess but we do At home we are so monotonously clean
architecturally that we cant make any aesthetic pretensions whatever
There is nothing artistic about white brick It is clean and neat and
sanitary but you get tired of looking at it especially when it is made
up in patterns with red brick mixed in And since you must be dirty
it may gratify you to know that you are very soothing to Transatlantic
nerves suffering from patterns like that But you are also misleading
I suppose I said to a workman in front of me as we entered Fleet
Street that is some old palace Do you know the date of it

No miss he answered that aint no palace Thems the new Law
Courts only built the last ten year

The new Law Courts The Strand Fleet Street Ludgate Hill
Cheapside and I was actually in those famous places riding through
them on a bus part of their multitude The very names on the street
corners held fascination enough and each of them gave me the separate
little thrill of the altogether unexpected I had unconsciously believed
that all these names were part of the vanished past I had connected them
with forgetting that in London names endure But I began to feel that I
ought to be arriving Conductor I said as he passed stop the bus
and let me get down at HalfMoon Street Piccadilly

Were goin strait awai from it miss you get that red bus standin
over therethatll taike you

So I went all the way back again and on to my relations on the top
of the red bus not at all regretting my mistake But it made it almost
twelve oclock when I rang the bellMrs Portheriss bellat the door
of her house in HalfMoon Street Piccadilly





IV



FROM the outside I didnt think much of Mrs Portheriss house It was
very tall and very plain and very narrow and quite expressionless
except that it wore a sort of dirty brown frown Like its neighbours it
had a well in front of it and steps leading down into the well and
an iron fence round the steps and a brass bellhandle lettered
Tradesmen Like its neighbours too it wore boxes of spotty black
greenery on the windowsillsin fact it was very like its neighbours
except that it had one or two solemn little black balconies that looked
as if nobody ever sat in them running across the face of it and a tall
shallow porch with two or three extremely white stone steps before the
front door HalfMoon Street to me looked like a family of housesa
family differing in heights and complexions and the colour of its hair
but sharing all the characteristics of a familyof an old family A
person draws a great many conclusions from the outside of a house
and my conclusion from the outside of my relations house was that she
couldnt be very well off to be obliged to live in such a plain and
gloomy locality with Tradesmen on the groundfloor and I hoped they
were not any noisy kind of tradesmen such as shoemakers or carpenters
who would disturb her early in the morning The cleanscrubbed stone
steps reflected very favourably I thought upon Mrs Portheris
and gave the house in spite of its grimy oldfashioned cramped
appearance a look of respectability which redeemed it But I did not
see at any window behind the spotty evergreens the sweet sad face of
my relation though there were a handorgan and a monkey and a German
band all operating within twenty yards of the house

I rang the bell The door opened a great deal more quickly than you
might imagine from the time I am taking to tell about it and I was
confronted by my first surprise in London It was a mana neat smooth
pale roundfaced man in livery rather fat and very sad It was also
Mrs Portheriss interior This was very dark and very quiet but what
light there was fell richly through a square stainedglass window at
the end of the hall upon the red and blue of some old china above
a door and a collection of Indian spears and a twisting old oak
staircase that glowed with colour Mrs Portheriss exterior had
prepared me for something different I did not know then that in London
everything is a matter of the insideI had not seen a Duchess living
crowded up to her ears with other peoples windows With us the outside
counts so tremendously An American duchess if you can imagine such
a person would consider it only due to the fitness of things that she
should have an imposing front yard and at least room enough at the back
for the clotheslines But this has nothing to do with HalfMoon Street

Does Mrs Portheris live here I asked thinking it was just possible
she might have moved

Yes miss said the footman with a subdued note of interrogation

I felt relieved Is sheis she well I inquired

Quite well miss he replied with the note of interrogation a little
more obvious

I should like to see her Is she in

Ill hinquire miss n Oo shall I sai miss

I thought I would prepare my relation gradually A lady from Chicago
said I

Very well miss Will you walk upstairs miss

In America drawingrooms are on the groundfloor I thought he wanted to
usher me into Mrs Portheriss bedroom

No sir I said Ill wait here Then I thought of Mr Mafferton
and of what he had said about saying sir to people and my sensations
were awful I have never done it once since

The footman reappeared in a few minutes with a troubled and apologetic
countenance Mrs Portheris says as she doesnt want anythink miss I
told her as I didnt understand you were disposin of anythink but that
was er message miss

I couldnt help laughingit was so very funny to think of my being
taken for a ladypedlar in the house of my relation Im very glad
shes in I said That is quite a mistake Tell her its Miss Mamie
Wick daughter of Colonel Joshua R Wick of Chicago but if shes lying
down or anything I can drop in again

He was away so long that I began to wonder if my relation suspected
me of dynamite in any form and he came back looking more anxious than
ever Mrs Portheris says shes very sorry miss and will you please
to walk up Certainly I said but I hope I wont be disturbing
her

And I walked up

It was a big square room with a big square piano in it and long
lace curtains and two or three giltframed mirrors and a great
many oldfashioned ornaments under glass cases and a tinkling glass
chandelier in the middle There were several oilpaintings on the
wallslownecked portraits and landscapes principally darkgreen
and black and yellow with cows and quantities of lovely china The
furniture was red brocade with spindly legs and there was a tall palm
in a pot which had nothing to do with the rest of the room by itself
in a corner I remembered these things afterwards

At the time I noticed chiefly two young persons with the pinkest cheeks
I ever saw out of a picturebook sitting near a window They were
dressed exactly alike and their hair hung down their backs to their
waists although they must have been seventeen and they sat up very
nicely indeed on two of the red chairs one occupied with worsted work
and the other apparently reading aloud to her though she stopped when I
came in I have seen something since at Madame Tussaudsbut I daresay
you have often noticed it yourself And standing in the middle of the
room with her hand on a centretable was Mrs Portheris

My first impression was that she had been standing there for the last
hour in that immovable way with exactly that remarkable expression and
it struck me that she could go on standing for the next without altering
it quite comfortablyshe seemed to be so solidly placed there with
her hand upon the table Though I wouldnt call Mrs Portheris stout
she was massiverather of an impressive build Her skirt fell in a
commanding way from her waist though it hitched up a little in front
which spoiled the effect She had broad square shoulders and a lace
collar and a cap with pink ribbons in it and grey hair smooth on each
side of her face and large wellcut features and the expression I
spoke of Ive seen the expression since among the Egyptian antiquities
in the British Museum but I am unable to describe it Armed
neutrality is the only phrase that occurs to me in connection with it
and that by no means does it justice For there was curiosity in it
as well as hostility and reservebut I wont try And she kept her
handit was her right handupon the table

Miss Wick she said bowing and dwelling upon the name with strong
doubt I believe I have a connection of that name in America Is your
fathers name Joshua Peter

Yes Mrs Portheris I replied and he says he is your nephew Ive
just come How do you do I said this because it was the only thing the
situation seemed to warrant me saying

Oh I am quite in my usual health thank you My nephew by marriagea
former marriagea very distant connection

Three thousand five hundred miles said I he lives in Chicago You
have never been over to see us Mrs Portheris At this point I walked
across to one of the spindly red chairs and sat down I thought then
that she had forgotten to ask me but even now when I know she hadnt
I am not at all sorry I sat down I find it is possible to stand up too
much in this country

The old lady gathered herself up and looked at me Where are your
father and mother she said

In Chicago Mrs Portheris All very well thank you I had a cable
from them this morning before I left the hotel Kind regards to you

Mrs Portheris looked at me in absolute silence Then she deliberately
arranged her back draperies and sat down toonot in any amiable way
but as if the situation must be faced

Margaret and Isabel she said to the two young pink persons go to
your rooms dears And she waited till the damsels each with a little
shy smile and blush gathered up their effects and went before she
continued the conversation As they left the room I observed that
they wore short dresses buttoned down the back It began to grow
very interesting to me after the first shock of finding this kind of
relation was over I found myself waiting for what was to come next
with the deepest interest In America we are very fond of typesperhaps
because we have so few among ourselvesand it seemed to me as I
sat there on Mrs Portheriss spindly red chair that I had come
into violent contact with a type of the most valuable and pronounced
description Privately I resolved to stay as long as I could and lose
no opportunity of observing it And my first observation was that Mrs
Portheriss expression was changinglosing its neutrality and beginning
to radiate active opposition and stern criticism with an uncompromising
sense of duty twisted in at the corners of the mouth There was no
agitation whatever and I thought with an inward smile of my relations
nerves

Then I suppose said Mrs Portheristhe supposition being of the
vaguest possible importancethat you are with a party of Americans
It seems to be an American idea to go about in hordes I never could
understand itto me it would be most obnoxious How many are there of
you

One Mrs Portherisand Im the one Poppa and momma had set their
hearts on coming Poppa thought of getting up an AngloAmerican Soda
Trust and momma wanted particularly to make your acquaintanceyour
various Christmas cards have given us all such a charming idea of
youbut at the last minute something interfered with their plans and
they had to give it up They told me to tell you how sorry they were

Something interfered with their plans But nothing interfered with your
plans

Oh no it was some political business of poppasnothing to keep me

Then do I actually understand that your parents of their own free
will permitted you to cross the Atlantic alone

I hope you do Mrs Portheris but if its not quite clear to you I
dont mind explaining it again

Upon my word And you are at an hotelwhich hotel When I told Mrs
Portheris the Mtropole her indignation mounted to her cap and one of
the pink ribbons shook violently

It is very American she said and I felt that Mrs Portheris could
rise to no more forcible a climax of disapproval

But I did not mind Mrs Portheriss disapproval in fact according to
my classification of her I should have been disappointed if she had not
disapprovedit would have been out of character So I only smiled as
sweetly as I could and said So am I

Is it not very expensive There was a note of angry wonder as well as
horror in this

I dont know Mrs Portheris Its very comfortable I never heard of
such a thing in my life said Mrs Portheris Itsits outrageous
Itsits not customary

I call it criminal lenience on the part of my nephew to allow it he
must have taken leave of his senses

Dont say anything nasty about poppa Mrs Portheris I remarked and
she paused

As to your mother

Momma is a lady of great intelligence and advanced views I
interrupted though she isnt very strong And she is very well
acquainted with me

Advanced views are your ruin in America May I ask how you found your
way here

On a bus Mrs Portheristhe red Hammersmith kind On two buses
rather because I took the wrong one first and went miles straight away
from here but I didnt mind itI liked it

In an omnibus I suppose you mean You couldnt very well be on
it unless you went on the top And Mrs Portheris smiled rather
derisively

I did I went on the top I returned calmly And it was lovely

Mrs Portheris very nearly lost her selfcontrol in her effort to grasp
this enormity Her cap bristled again and the muscles round her mouth
twitched quite perceptibly

Careering all over London on the top of an omnibus she ejaculated
Looking for my house And in that frock I felt about ten when she
talked about my frock Couldnt you feel that you were altogether too
smart for such a position

No indeed Mrs Portheris I replied unacquainted with the idiom
When I got down off the first omnibus in Cheapside I felt as if I
hadnt been half smart enough

She did not notice my misunderstanding By the time I had finished my
sentence she was rapping the table with suppressed excitement

Miss Wick she saidand I had expected her to call me Mamie and say
I was the image of poppayou are the daughter of my nephewwhich can
hardly be called a connection at allbut on that account I will give
you a piece of advice The top of an omnibus is not a proper place for
youI might say for any connection of mine however distant I would
not feel that I was doing my duty toward my nephews daughter if I did
not tell you that you must not go there Dont on any account do it
again It is a thing people never do

Do they upset I asked

They might But apart from that I must ask you on personalon family
groundsalways to go inside In Chicago you may go outside as much as
you like but in London

Oh no I interrupted I wouldnt for the worldin Chicago which
Mrs Portheris didnt seem to understand

I had stayed dauntlessly for half an hourI was so much interested in
Mrs Portherisand I began to feel my ability to prolong the interview
growing weaker I was sorryI would have given anything to have heard
her views upon higher education and female suffrage and the Future
State and the Irish Question but it seemed impossible to get her
thoughts away from the appalling Impropriety which I on her spindly
red chair represented I couldnt blame her for thatI suppose no
impropriety bigger than a spider had ever got into her drawingroom
before So I got up to go Mrs Portheris also rose with majesty I
think she wanted to show me what if I had been properly brought up I
might have expected reasonably to develop into She stood in the midst
of her red brocaded furniture with her hands folded a model of what
bringing up can do if it is unflinchingly persevered in and all the
mirrors reflected the ideal she presented I felt beside her as if I
had never been brought up at all

Have you any friends in London she asked with a very weak solution
of curiosity in her tone giving me her hand to facilitate my going and
immediately ringing the bell

I think not I said with decision

But you will not continue to stay at the Mtropole I beg that you
will not remain another day at the Mtropole It is not usual for young
ladies to stay at hotels You must go to some place where only ladies
are received and as soon as you are settled in one communicate at
once with the rector of the parishalone as you are that is quite a
necessary step lights and fires will probably be extra

I thought said I of going to the Lady Guides Associationwe have
heard of it in Chicago through some friends who went round every day
for three weeks with ladyguides and found it simply fascinatingand
asking them to get me a private family to board with I particularly
wished to see what a private family is like in England

Mrs Portheris frowned I could never bring myself to approve of
ladyguides she said There is something in the idea that is
altogether tooAmerican I saw that the conversation was likely to
grow personal again so I said Well goodbye Mrs Portheris and
was just going when Stop said my relation there is Miss Purkiss

Is there said I

Certainlythe very thing Miss Purkiss is a very old friend of mine
in reduced circumstances Ive known her thirtyfive years She is an
excellent woman with the most trustworthy views upon all matters In
so far as our widely different social positions have permitted Miss
Purkiss and I have been on terms I may say of sisterly intimacy
since before you were born She has no occupation now having lost her
position as secretary to the Home for Incurable Household Pets through
illhealth and a very limited income She lives in an excessively
modest way in Upper Baker Streetvery convenient to both the omnibuses
and Undergroundand if you cast in your lot with hers while you are in
England Miss Wickhere Mrs Portheris grew almost demonstrativeyou
need never go out alone I need not say that she is a lady but her
circumstances will probably necessitate her asking you rather more
than the usual rate for board and lodging in compensation for her
chaperonage and companionship All I can say is that both will be very
thorough I will give you Miss Purkisss address at once and if you
drive there immediately you will be sure to find her in John call
a hansom And Mrs Portheris went to her writingtable and wrote the
address

There she said folding it up and giving it to me By all means try
to arrange with Miss Purkiss and she being a friend of my own some
afternoon perhapsI must think about itI may ask her to bring you to
tea Goodbye

As the door closed behind me I heard Mrs Portheriss voice on the
landing Margaret and Isabel it said you may come down now

Ware to miss said the driver

Htel Mtropole said I And as we turned into Piccadilly a little
flutter of torn white paper went back on the wind to Mrs Portheris It
was Miss Purkisss address

After lunch I made careful notes of Mrs Portheris and then spent half
an hour in the midst of my trunks looking in the Board and Lodging
column of the Morning Post for accommodation which promised to differ
as radically as possible from Miss Purkisss





V

MY principal idea was to get away as soon as possible from the
Mtropole So long as I was located there I was within the grasp of my
relation and as soon as she found out my insubordination in the matter
of her advice I had no doubt whatever that my relation would appear
with Miss Purkiss all in rusty black behind hera contingency I
wished to avoid Miss Purkiss I reflected would probably be another
type and types were interesting but not to live withmy relation
had convinced me of that And as to Mrs Portheris herself while I had
certainly enjoyed what I had been privileged to see of her her society
was a luxury regarding which I felt that I could exercise considerable
selfdenial I did not really contemplate being forced into Miss Purkiss
and Upper Baker Street by Mrs Portheris against my will not for
a moment but I was afraid the situation would be presented on
philanthropic grounds which would be disagreeable Miss Purkiss as a
terror I felt equal to but Miss Purkiss as an object of charity might
cow me And Miss Purkiss in any staying capacity was not I felt what
I came to Great Britain to experience So I studied the columns of the
Morning Post diligently for a haven of refuge from Miss Purkiss

I found it difficult to make a selection the havens were so very
different and all so superior I believe you talk about the originality
of American advertising I never in my life saw a newspaper page to
compare in either imagination or vocabulary with the one I scanned that
day at the Mtropole It seemed that I could be taken all over London
at prices varying from one g to three gs per week although the
surprising cheapness of this did not strike me until I had laboriously
calculated in dollars and cents the exact value of a g I know now
that it is a term of English currency exclusively employed in Bond
Street Piccadilly Regent and Oxford Streetsthey never give you a
price there in any other And the phrases descriptive of the various
homes which were awaiting me were so beautiful Excellent meat
breakfast a liberal and charminglyrefined home a mothers devoted
supervision fresh young society fashionably situated and
elegantly furnished just vacated by a clergyman foreign languages
understoodwhich would doubtless include Americana lofty standard
of culture in this establishment I wondered if they kept it under
glass I was struck with the number of people who appeared in print
with offerings of a domiciliary nature A widow lady of cheerful
temperament and artistic tastes offers The daughter of a late
Civil Servant with a larger house than she requires offers This
must have been a reference put in to excite sympathy otherwise what
was the use of advertising the gentleman after he was dead Even from
the sympathetic point of view I think it was a mistake for who would
care to go and settle in a house the minute the crape was off the door
Nobody

Not only original advertisements of the kind I was looking for but
original advertisements of kinds I wasnt looking for appealed to my
interest and took up my time that afternoon

Would any one feel disposed to lend an actress five pounds

Temporary home wanted with a family of quiet habits in a healthful
neighbourhood who can give best references for a Persian cat An
elderly country rector and his wife in town for a months holiday
would be glad of a little pleasant society

A young subaltern of excellent family in unfortunate circumstances
implores the loan of a hundred pounds to save him from ruin Address
care of his solicitors A young gentleman handsome an orphan of
good education and agreeable address wishes to meet with elderly couple
with means inherited who would adopt him Would make himself pleasant
in the house Church of England preferred but no serious objection to
Nonconformists

We have nothing like this in America It was a revelation to mea most
private and intimate revelation of a social body that I had always been
told no outsider could look into without the very best introductions Of
course there was the veil of A B and Lurline and the solicitors
address but that seemed as thin and easily torn as the Morning Post
and much more transparent showing all the struggling mass with its
hands outstretched on the other side And yet I have heard English
people say how personal our newspapers are

My choice was narrowed considerably by so many of the addresses being
other places than London which I thought very peculiar in a London
newspaper Having come to see London I did not want to live in Putney
or Brixton or Chelsea or Maida Vale I supposed vaguely that there
must be cathedrals or Roman remains or attractions of some sort in
these places or they would not be advertised in London but for the
time being at any rate I intended to content myself with the capital
So I picked out two or three places near the British MuseumI should be
sure I thought to want to spend a great deal of time thereand went
to see about them

They were as much the same as the advertisements were different
especially from the outside From the outside they were exactly
alikeso much so that I felt after I had seen them all that if
another boarder in the same row chose to approach me on any occasion
and say that she was me I should be entirely unable to contradict her
This in itself was prejudicial In America if there is one thing we are
particular about it is our identity Without our identities we are in
a manner nowhere I did not feel disposed to run the risk of losing mine
the minute I arrived in England especially as I knew that it is a thing
Americans who stay here for any length of time are extremely apt to do
Nevertheless I rang the three doorbells I left the Mtropole with
the intention of ringing and there were some minor differences inside
although my pen insists upon recording the similarities instead I spent
the same length of time upon the doorstep for instance before the same
tumbled and apologeticlooking servant girl appeared wiping her hands
upon her apron and let me into the same little dark hall with the same
interminable stairs twisting over themselves out of it and the smell of
the same dinner accompanying us all the way up To be entirely just it
was a wholesome dinner but there was so much of it in the air that I
very soon felt as if I was dining unwarrantably and ought to pay for
it In every case the staircarpet went up two flights and after that
there was oilcloth rather forgetful as to its original pattern and
much frayed as to its edgesand after that nothing Always pails and
brushes on the landingswhat there is about pails and brushes that
should make them such a distinctive feature of boardinghouse landings
I dont know but they are Not a single elevator in all three I
asked the servantgirl in the first place about halfway up the fourth
flight if there was no elevator No indeed miss she said I
wishes there was But thems things you wont find but very seldom ere
Weve ad American ladies ere before and they allus asks for em but
they soon finds out they aint to be ad miss

Now how did she know I was an American lady I didnt really mind
about the elevator but this I found annoying in spite of my desire
to preserve my identity In the course of conversation with this young
woman I discovered that it was not my own possibly prospective dinner
that I smelt on the stairs I asked about the hour for meals Aou we
never gives meals miss she said Its only them boardin aouses as
gives meals in Mrs Jones she only lets apartments But theres a
very nice restirong in Tottinim Court Road quite convenient an your
breakfast miss you could ave cooked ere but of course it would be
hextra miss

Then I remembered all I had read about people in London living in
lodgings and having their tea and sugar and butter and eggs consumed
unrighteously by the landlady who was always represented as a buxom
person in calico with a smut on her face and her arms akimbo and an
awful hypocrite For a minute I thought of trying it for the novelty
of the experience but the loneliness of it made me abandon the idea I
could not possibly content myself with the society of a coalscuttle
and two candlesticks and the alternative of going round sightseeing by
myself Nor could I in the least tell whether Mrs Jones was agreeable
or whether I could expect her to come up and visit with me sometimes in
the evenings besides if she always wore smuts and had her arms akimbo
I shouldnt care about asking her In America a landlady might as likely
as not be a member of a Browning Society and give evenings but that
kind of landlady seems indigenous to the United States And after Mrs
Portheris I felt that I required the companionship of something human

In the other two places I saw the landladies themselves in their
respective drawingrooms on the second floor One of the drawingrooms
was draped in a way that was quite painfully aesthetic considering
the paucity of the draperies The flowerpots were draped and the
lamps there were draperies round the pianolegs and round the clock
and where there were not draperies there were bows all of the same
scanty description The only thing that had not made an effort to clothe
itself in the room was the poker and by contrast it looked very nude
There were some Japanese ideas around the room principally a paper
umbrella and a big painted palmleaf fan from India made an incident in
one corner I thought even before I saw the landlady that it would be
necessary to live up to a high standard of starvation in that house and
she confirmed the impression She was a Miss Hippy a short stoutish
person with very smooth hair thin lips and a nose like an angle of
the Pyramids preternaturally neat in her appearance with a long
gold watchchain round her neck She came into the room in a way that
expressed reduced circumstances and a protest against being obliged to
do it I feel that the particular variety of smile she gave me with her
Good morningalthough it was after  PMwas one she kept for the
use of boarders only and her whole manner was an interrogation When
she said Is it for yourself in answer to my question about rooms I
felt that I was undergoing a crossexamination the result of which Miss
Hippy was mentally tabulating

We have a few rooms said Miss Hippy certainly Then she cast her
eyes upon the floor and twisted her fingers up in her watchchain as
if in doubt Shall you be long in London

I said I couldnt tell exactly

Have youare you a professional of any kind inquired Miss Hippy
Not that I object to professional ladiesthey are often very
pleasant Madame Solfreno resided here for several weeks while she
was retrenching but Madame Solfreno was of course more or less
an exceptional woman She did not careat least while she was
retrenchingfor the society of other professionals and she said that
was the great advantage of my housenone of them ever would come here
Still as I say I have no personal objection to professionals In
fact we have had headladies here and real ladies I must say I have
generally found them Although hands of course I would not take

I said I was not a professional

Oh said Miss Hippy pitiably baffled Then perhaps you are not
aa young lady That is of course one can see you are that but you
areyou are married perhaps

I am not married madame I said Have you any rooms to let

Miss Hippy rose ponderingly I might as well show you what we have
she said

I think I replied that you might as well Otherwise I will not
detain you any longer At which curiously enough all hesitation
vanished from Miss Hippys manner and she showed me all her rooms and
expatiated upon all their advantages with a single eye to persuading me
to occupy one of them So comprehensively voluble was she indeed and
so impenetrably did she fill up the door with her broad person when we
came down again that I found no loophole of escape anywhere and was
obliged to descend to equivocal measures Have you any rooms Miss
Hippy I inquired on the ground floor

That returned Miss Hippy as if I had put her the only possible
question that she was not prepared for I have not A gentleman from
the West IndiesMiss Hippy went on impressivelyhardly ever
without inflammatory rheumatism which you will admit makes stairs an
impossibility for him occupies my only groundfloor bedroomjust off
the diningroom

That is unfortunate I said since I think in this house I would
prefer a room on the groundfloor But if I decide to take one of the
others I will let you know Miss Hippy

Miss Hippys countenance fell changed and again became expressive of
doubtthis time offensively

Ive not asked for any references though of course it is my
custom

You will receive references I interrupted as soon as you require
them Good afternoon We were standing in the hall and Miss Hippy
from force of circumstances was obliged to unfasten the door but I did
not hear from her as I passed out into the street any responsive Good
afternoon

My third experience was quite antipodal to Miss Hippy Her parlour was
Japanesy too in places but it was mostly chipped and it had a great
many rather soiled fat cushions in it quite a perceptible odour of beer
and tobacco and a pair of gentlemans worked slippers under the sofa
The atmosphere was relaxing after Miss Hippy and suggested liberality
of all sorts but the slippers to say nothing of the odours which
might have floated in from other regions made it impossible I waited
for the lady of the house a conscious hypocrite

She came in at last voluminously rather out of breath but with great
warmth of manner Do sit down she said

Now it does seem strange Only las night at the table we were
sayin how much we wanted one more lady boarder You see Ive got four
young gentlemen in the City here and of us ladies theres just four so
we sometimes get up a little dance amongst ourselves in the evenins
It amuses the young people and much better wear out carpets than pay
doctors bills say I Now I generally play an that leaves only
three ladies for the four gentlemen you see Now isnt it a curious
coincidence she said leaning forward with a broad and confident
smile that you should have come in today just after we were savin
how nice it would be if there were enough to get up the Lancers

I bowed my acknowledgments

You want a room for yourself I suppose my hostess went on
cheerfully My top flat Im sorry to say is every bit taken
There isnt an inch of room up there but Ive got a beautiful little
apartment on the groundfloor you could use as a bedsittin room
lookin out on what green grass we have Ill show it to youand she
led me across the hall to a dismantled cupboard the door of which she
threw open That she said you could have for twentyfive shillins
a week Of course it is small but thenso is the price and she
smiled the cheerful accustomed smile that went with the joke Ive
another up here she said leading the way to the first landing
rather biggerthirty shillins You see theyre both bein turned out
at present so its rather unfavourableand the lady drew in the deep
breath she had lost going up the stairs

I could think of only one thing to say I believe you said your top
flat was all taken I remarked amiably She was such a goodnatured
soul I couldnt bear to say anything that would hurt her feelings
That is unfortunate I particularly wanted a room in a top flat But if
I decide on one of these others Ill let you know There were two fibs
and diametrically opposed fibs within half an hour and I know its
excessively wrong to fib but under the circumstances what could you
say

Do miss And though I wouldnt for the world persuade you I
certainly hope you will for Im sure youd make a very pleasant
addition to our party Ill just let you out myself And she did

I DROVE straight back to the Mtropole very thankful indeed that that
was evidently the thing to do next If there had been no evident thing
to do next I was so depressed in my mind that I think I would have
taken a ticket to Liverpool that night and my passage to New York on
the first steamer that was leaving I wont say what I did in the cab
but I spoilt a perfectly new veil doing it London seemed dingy and
noisy and puzzling and unattractive and always going to rain I
thought of our bright clear air in Chicago and our nice clean houses
and our streetcars and our sodawater fountains and poppa and momma
and always knowing everybody and what to do under every circumstance
and all the way to the Mtropole I loved Chicago and I hated London
But there was the Mtropole big and solid and luxurious and a fact
I understood and there was the nice respectful housemaid on my
corridorit would be impossible to convince you how different servants
are with usand a delightful little fire in my room and a tin pitcher
of hot water smoking in the basin and a sort of air of being personally
looked after that was very comforting to my nerves While I was
getting ready for dinner I analysed my state of mind and blamed myself
severely for I found that I could not justify one of the disagreeable
things I had been thinking in any philosophical way I had simply
allowed the days experiences capped by my relation in the morning to
overcome my entire nervesystem which was childish and unreasonable I
wished then and often since that Providence had given us a more useful
kind of nervesystem on our side of the Atlanticsomething constructed
solidly on the British plan and just as I was wishing that there came
a rap A rap has comparatively no significance until it comes at your
bedroom door when you are alone in a big hotel two thousand five hundred
miles from home Then it means something This one meant two cards on a
salver and a message One of the cards read Mrs Cummers Portheris
with Miss Purkiss written under it in pencil the other Mr Charles
Mafferton with  Hertford Street Mayfair in one corner and The
Isthmian Club in the other

Is she there now I asked the servant in acute suspense

No miss The ladies they called about alfpast three and we was to
say that one lady was to be ere again tomorrow mornin at ten miss
The gentleman he didnt leave no message

Then my heart beat again and joyfully for I knew that I had missed my
relation and Miss Purkiss and that the way of escape was still open to
me although ten oclock in the morning was rather early to be obliged
to go out I must say I thought it extremely foolish of Miss Purkiss to
have mentioned the hourit was like a fox making an appointment with
a rabbit a highly improbable thing for the rabbit to keep And I went
downstairs feeling quite amused and happy and determined to stay
amused and happy My unexpected reward for this came at dinner when
I discovered my neighbours to be two delightful ladies from St
Paul Minn with whom I conversed sociably there and later in the
drawingroom They had known Dr Oliver Wendell Holmes but what to my
eyes gave them an added charm was their amiable readiness to know me
I was made to promise that I would send them my address when I was
settled and to this day I suffer from unquieted pangs of conscience
because I failed to keep my word

By ten oclock next morning I was in Cockspur Street Pall Mall looking
for the Lady Guides Association The name in white letters on the
window struck me oddly when I found it The idea the institution it
expressed seemed so grotesquely of today there in the heart of old
London where almost everything you see talks of orthodoxy and the
approval of the centuries It had the impertinence that a new building
has going up among your smoky old piles of brick and mortar You will
understand my natural sympathy with it The minute I went in I felt at
home

There were several little desks in several little adjoining
compartments with little muslin curtains in front of them and ladies
and inkbottles inside like a row of shrouded canarycages Two or
three more ladies without their things on were running round outside
and several others with their things on were being attended to I saw
only one little man who was always getting out of the ladies way and
didnt seem properly to belong there There was no label attached so
I couldnt tell what use they made of him but I should like to have
known

The desks were all lettered plainlyone Lady Guides the next
Tickets for the Theatre and so on but of course I went to the
first one to inquire without taking any notice of thatpeople always
do I think perhaps the lady was more polite in referring me to
the proper one than the man would have been She smiled and bowed
encouragingly as she did it and explained particularly the lady with
the eyeglasses and her hair done up highdo you see I saw and went
to the right lady She smiled too in a real winning way looking up
from her entrybook and leaning forward to hear what I had to say Then
she came into my confidence as it were at once What you want
she said is a boardinghouse or private hotel We have all the best
private hotels on our books but in your case being alone what I
should advise would be a thoroughly wellrecommended firstclass
boardinghouse

I said something about a private familyOr a private family added
the lady acquiescently Now we can give you whichever you
prefer Suppose she said with the kindly interested counsel of
goodfellowship dropping her voice a little I write you out several
addresses of both kinds then you can just see for yourselfand the
lady looked at me over her eyeglasses most agreeably

Why yes I said I think thats a very good idea

Well now just wait a minute the lady said turning over the pages
of another big book Theres a great deal as you probably know
in locality in London We must try and get you something in a nice
locality Piccadilly for instance is a very favourite localityI
think we have something in HalfMoon Street

Gracious I said No not HalfMoon Street please IIve been
there I dont like that locality

Really said the lady with surprise Well you wouldnt believe what
the rents are in HalfMoon Street But we can easily give you something
elsethe other side of the Park perhaps

Yes I said earnestly Quite the other side if you please

Well returned the lady abstractedly running her finger down the
page theres Mrs Pragge in Holland Park Gardenshave you any
objection to childrenand Miss Camblewell in Lancaster Gate very
clean and nice I think well put them down And then two or three
private onesexcuse me one minute There I think among those with
sudden gravity you ought to find something suitable at from two to
threeandahalf guineas per week but if you do not be sure to come in
again We always like to give our clients satisfaction The lady smiled
again in that pardonable endearing way and I was so pleased with her
and with myself and with the situation and felt such warm comfort as
the result of the interview that I wanted badly to shake hands with her
when I said Goodmorning But she was so engaged that I couldnt and
had to content myself with only saying it very cordially As I turned to
go I saw a slightly blank expression come over her face and she coughed
with some embarrassment leaning forward as if to speak to me again
But I was too near the door so one of the ladies who were running about
detained me apologetically

There is aa charge she said of twoandsixpence You did not
know So I went back uncomfortably and paid Thanks yes said the
lady in the cage Twoandsix No that is two shillings a florin
you seeand that is fourits halfacrown we want isnt it very
amiably considering all the trouble I was giving her Perhaps you
are not very well accustomed to our English currency yet as I
finally counted out one shilling two sixpences a threepence and six
halfpennies If there is a thing in this country that needs reforming
more than the House of Lordsbut there it isnt to be supposed that
you would like my telling you about it At all events I managed in the
end to pay my very proper fee to the Lady Guides Association and
I sincerely hope that any of its members who may happen to read this
chapter will believe that I never endeavoured to evade it The slight
awkwardness of the mistake turned out rather pleasantly for me because
it led me into further conversation with the lady behind the eyeglasses
in which she asked me whether I wouldnt like to look over their
establishment I said Yes indeed and one of the outside ladies a very
capablelooking little person with a round face and short curly hair
was told off to take me upstairs I hadnt been so interested for a long
time There was the clubroom where ladies belonging to the Association
could meet or make appointments with other people or write letters or
read the papers and the restaurant where they could get anything they
wanted to eat I am telling you all this because Ive met numbers of
people in London who only know enough about the Lady Guides Association
to smile when it is mentioned and to say Did you go there in a
tone of great amusement which considering it is one of your own
institutions strikes me as curious And it is such an original
personal homelike institution like a little chirping busy nest between
the eaves of the great unconcerned City offices and warehouses that it
is interesting to know more about than that I think The capable little
lady seemed quite proud of it as she ushered me from one room into
the next and especially of the bedrooms which were divided from one
another by pretty chintz hangings and where at least four ladies
arriving strange from the country and elsewhere could be tucked away
for the night That idea struck me as perfectly sweet and I wished
very sincerely I had known of it before It seemed to offer so many
more advantages than the Mtropole Of course I asked any number of
questions about the scope and working of the Association and the little
lady answered them all with great fluency It was nice to hear of
such extended usefulnesshow the Lady Guides engage governesses
or servants or seats at the theatre and provide dinners and
entertainments and clothes to wear at them and suitable manners and
take care of children by the dayI do not remember whether the
little lady said they undertook to bring them upand furnish eyes
and understanding certified to all visitors in London at a fixed
tariffall except gentlemen unaccompanied by their families Such
clients the little lady said with a shade of sadness I fancied that
there should be any limitation to the benevolence of the Association
the Lady Guide is compelled to decline It is a great pitywe have so
many gentlemanapplicants and there would be of course no necessity
for sending young ladyguides out with themwe have plenty of
elderly ones widows and so on butand here the little lady grew
confidentially deprecatingit is thought best not to You see it
would get into the papers and the papers might chaff and of course
in our position we cant afford to be made ridiculous But it is a great
pityand the little lady sighed again I said I thought it was and
asked if any special case had been made of any special entreaty One
she admitted in a justifying tone A gentleman from Japan He told
us he never would have come to England if he had not heard of our
Association being a perfect stranger without a friend in the place

And unacquainted with English prejudices I put in

Quite so And what could we do

What did you do I inquired

We sent two responded the little lady triumphing once more over the
situation Nobody could say a thing to that And he was such a pleasant
little man and thanked us so cordially

 Did you find him intelligent I asked

Very But the little ladys manner was growing rather fidgety and
it occurred to me that perhaps I was taking more information than I was
entitled to for twoandsix So I went reluctantly downstairs wishing
there was something else that the ladyguides could do for me A little
blackeyed woman down there was giving some very businesslike orders
Half a days shopping I should say send Miss Stuart Saville And tell
her to be very particular about her accounts Has Mrs Mason got that
private ward yet

That said my little cicerone in a subdued tone is our manageress
She planned the whole thing Wonderful head Is that so I remarked
I should like to congratulate her

Im afraid there isnt time she returned looking flurried and the
manageress doesnt approve of anybody wasting it Will you write your
name in our visitors book

With pleasure I said and Ill come again whenever I feel that I
want anything And I wrote my namebadly of course as people always
do in visitors books but with the lively satisfaction people always
experience in writing their nameswhy Ive never been able to
discover I passed the manageress on my way out She was confronting a
pair of ladies an old and a young one in black who leaned on their
parasols with an air of amiable indecision and falteringly addressed
her I had a day and a half last week one of them said rather
weakly is theredo you want me for anything this

The manageress looked at her with some impatience If I want you Ill
send for you Miss Gypsum she said The door closed upon me at that
moment so I dont know how Miss Gypsum got away

As for me I walked through Cockspur Street and through Waterloo
Place and so into Piccadilly reflecting upon Mrs Pragge and Miss
Camblewell and all their uncertainties Standing in the lee of a large
policeman on one of your valuable iron refuges in the middle of the
street a flounced blackandwhite parasol suddenly shut down almost
in my face The lady belonging to it leaned over her carriage and said
How dye do Miss Dear me how stupid I am about names Miss
Chicagoyoungladywhoranawaywithoutgettingmyaddress Now Ive
found you just pop in

I must ask you to drive on madam the policeman said

As soon as this young lady has popped in There Now my dear what did
the relation say Ive been longing to know

And before I realised another thing I was rolling up Regent Street
statefully in the carriage of Mrs Torquilin





VII



ARE you going there now Mrs Torquilin went on Because Im only
out for an airing I can drop you anywhere you like Oh by no means
thank you Mrs Torquilin I said Ive been there already

Mrs Torquilin looked at me with an extraordinary expression On top it
was conscientiously shocked underneath it was extremely curious amused
by anticipation and through it all kindly

You dont get on she said What did I tell you Mark my words I
said to Charlie Mafferton that child knows nothing of what is ahead of
her But pray go on What happened

I went on and told Mrs Torquilin what happened a good deal as I have
told you but I am afraid not so properly because she was very much
amused and I suppose if the story of my interview with Mrs Portheris
excited any feeling in your mind it was one of sympathy for me At
least that was what I intended But I was so happy in Mrs Torquilins
carriage and so delighted to be talking to somebody I knew that I made
as funny an account of the tender greetings of my relation as I could
and it lasted all the way to the Mtropole where I was to be dropped
I referred to her always as my relation because Mrs Torquilin seemed
to enjoy the expression Incidentally too I told her about my plans
and showed her the addresses I had from the ladyguide and she was kind
enough to say that if I did not find them satisfactory I must let her
know and she could send me to a person of her acquaintance where I
should be very comfy dear and I believed her You see she said
I should like to take a little interest in your plans because you seem
to be the only really American girl Ive come upon in the whole course
of my travels The New York ones were all English imitationsI had no
patience with them

Oh I responded cheerfully thats only on the outside Mrs
Torquilin If you ran down the Stars and Stripes I guess you would find
them pretty American

Well yes Mrs Torquilin admitted I remember that was the case
but just then we stopped in front of the Mtropole and I begged her
to come in and lunch with me Dear me child no I must be off
she said but I used all the persuasion I could and represented how
dreadfully lonely it was for me and Mrs Torquilin hesitated At the
moment of her hesitation there floated out from the diningroom a most
appetising suggestion of fried soles What small matters contribute to
important results I dont know anything that I have more cause to
be grateful to than that little wandering odour For Mrs Torquilin
encountering it said with some feeling Poor child Ive no doubt it
is lonely for you Perhaps I really ought to cheer you up a bitIll
come

And Mrs Torquilin and I pursued the wandering odour into the
diningroom

We had a particularly good lunch and we both enjoyed it immensely
though Mrs Torquilin made a fuss about my ordering champagne and said
it was simply ruinous and I really ought to have somebody to look after
me By the way she said have you seen anything of the Maffertons
I told her that Mr Mafferton had left his card the afternoon before
but I was out You were out said Mrs Torquilin What a pity I
said no I wasnt very sorry because I felt so unsettled in my mind
that I was sure I couldnt work myself up to an intelligent discussion
of any of Mr Maffertons favourite subjects and he would hardly have
found much pleasure in his visit Oh I think he would said Mrs
Torquilin What on earth has intelligent discussion to do with it
I know the Maffertons very well she went on looking at me quite
sharply Excellent familycousins of Lord Mafferton of Mafferton
Charlie has enough but not too much I should say However thats
neither here nor there for he has no expensive habits to my
knowledge

Just imagine I said his being cousin to a lord And yet hes not a
bit haughty Have you ever seen the lord Mrs Torquilin

Bless the child yes Gone down to dinner with him more than once
Between ourselves said Mrs Torquilin confidentially hes an old
bruteneither more nor less But one cant be rude to the man What
hell have to say to it heaven only knows But Charlie is quite capable
of snapping his fingers at him Do have one of these ices

I was immensely interested What has Mr Mafferton been doing I
asked

Ive no reason to believe hes done it yet said Mrs Torquilin a
little crossly I thought Perhaps he wont

Im sure I hope not I returned Mr Mafferton is so nice that it
would be a pity if he got into trouble with his relations especially if
one of them is a lord

Then dont let him said Mrs Torquilin more crossly than before

Do you think I would have any influence with him I asked her I
should doubt it very much Mr Mafferton doesnt strike me as a
person at all susceptible to ladies influence But if I knew the
circumstances I might try

Oh come along child Mrs Torquilin returned folding up the napkin
Youre too stupid Ill see the Maffertons in a day or two and Ill
tell them what I think of you Is there nothing else youll have Then
let us depart and make room for somebody else And I followed Mrs
Torquilin out of the room with a vague consciousness that she had an
important voice in the management of the hotel and had been kind enough
to give me my lunch

My friend did not take leave of me in the hall Id like to see the
place she said Take me up into the drawingroom

Mrs Torquilin admired the drawingroom very much Sumptuous she
said Sumptuous And as I walked round it with her I felt a particular
kind of pleasure in being the more familiar with it of the two and
a little pride too in its luxury which I had always been told was
specially designed to suit Americans I was so occupied with these
feelings and with Mrs Torquilins remarks that I did not observe two
ladies on a sofa at the end of the room until we were almost in front
of them Then I noticed that one of the ladies was sitting bolt upright
with a stern majestic eye fixed full upon me apparently frozen with
indignation I also noticed that it was Mrs Portheris The other lady
in rusty black as I knew she would be occupied the farther end of the
sofa very much wilted indeed

Miss Wick said Mrs Portheris portentously standing up I have
been shopping in the interval but my friend Miss Purkissthis is Miss
Purkiss Miss Purkiss this is Miss Wick the connection from Chicago
whom you so kindly consented to try to befriendMiss Purkiss has been
here since ten oclock You will excuse her risingshe is almost I
might say in a state of collapse

I turned round to Mrs Torquilin

Mrs Torquilin I said this is my relation Mrs Portheris Mrs
PortherisMrs Torquilin In America we always introduce

But I was astonished at the change in Mrs Torquilin She seemed to
have grown quite two inches taller and she was regarding Mrs Portheris
through a pair of eyeglasses on a stick in the most inexplicable manner
with her mouth set very firmly indeed in a sort of contemptuous smile

Mrs Cummers Portheris she said Yes I think Mrs Cummers Portheris
knows me You did not tell me dear that Mrs Portheris was your
relationbut you need not fear that I shall think any the less of you
for that

Heppy said Mrs Portheris throwing up her chin but looking
distinctly nervous your temper is much the same I am sorry to see as
it always was

Mrs Torquilin opened her mouth to reply but closed it again
resolutely with an expression of infinite disdain Then to my
surprise she took a chair in a way that told me distinctly of her
intention not to desert me I felt at the moment that I would have given
anything to be desertedthe situation was so very embarrassing The
only thing I could think of to do was to ask Miss Purkiss if she and
Mrs Portheris wouldnt have some lunch Miss Purkiss looked quite
cheerful for a moment and began to unbutton her glove but her
countenance fell when my unfeeling relation forbade her with a look and
said Thank you no Miss Wick Having waited so long we can easily
manage without food a little longer Let us get to our arrangements
Perhaps Miss Purkiss will tell Miss Wick what she has to offer her
Mrs Portheris was evidently trying to ignore Mrs Torquilin and
sat offensively and sideways to her but she could not keep the
apprehension out of her eye

Certainly I said but Miss Purkiss must have something I was
determined to decline but I wished to do it as mercifully as possible
Tell somebody I said to a servant who had come up to poke the fire
to bring up some claret and crackers

Biscuits child put in Mrs Torquilin is what you mean Biscuits
the young lady meansto the servantand be sharp about it for we
want to go out immediately ThenMay I ask what arrangements you were
thinking of offering Miss Wickto Miss Purkiss

Miss Purkiss began quaveringly that she had never done such a thing in
her life before but as Mrs Portheris particularly wished it

For your own good Jane interrupted Mrs Portheris entirely for
your own good I dont call that gratitude

Miss Purkiss hastily admitted that it was for her own good of course
and that Mrs Portheris knew her far too well to believe for a moment
that she was not grateful but I could have a nice back bedroom on the
second floor and the use of her sittingroom all day and I being
recommended by Mrs Portheris she wouldnt think of many extras Well
if there were fires lights the use of the bath and piano boots and
friends to meals that would be all

It is quite impossible said Mrs Torquilin Im sorry you had the
trouble of coming In the first place I fear my young friend with
emphasis and a cursory glance at Mrs Portheriss chair would find it
dull in Upper Baker Street In the secondMrs Torquilin hesitated for
a moment and then made the plungeI have taken a flat for the season
and Miss Wick is coming to me I believe that is our little plan my
dearwith a meaning smile to me Then Mrs Torquilin looked at
Mrs Portheris as if she were wondering whether there could be any
discoverable reason why my relation should stay any longer Mrs
Portheris rose routed but with a calm eye and a steady front In that
case I hope you will be forbearing with her Heppy she said Remember
that she is a stranger to our ways of thinking and doing and has
probably never had the advantages of upbringing that you and I have I
have no doubt however that my nephew Colonel Wick has done his best
for her As you are probably aware he is worth his million

Mrs Torquilin missed the sarcasm Not I she returned coolly
but Im sure Im very glad to hear it for Miss Wicks sake As to my
temper Ive noticed that those know most about it who best deserve it
I dont think you need worry yourself about your young connection Mrs
Cummers Portheris

No said I meekly I should hate to be a weight on your mind

Mrs Portheris took my hand in quite an affecting manner

Then I leave you Miss Wick she said to this ladyand to
Providence

 Between them I said I ought to have a very good time Mrs Portheris dropped my hand I feel she said that I have done my part toward you but remember if ever you want a home Miss Purkiss will take you in When in doubt

Play trumps said Mrs Torquilin from the window where she stood
with her back to all of us I always do Is that your carriage waiting
outside Mrs Cummers Portheris

It is said my relation betrayed into asperity I hope you have no
objection to it

Oh nonenot the least But the horses seem very restive

Come Miss Purkiss said my relation

The wine and biscuits dear love said Miss Purkiss are just
arriving

But Mrs Portheris was bowing with stately indefiniteness to Mrs
Torquilins back

Come Miss Purkiss she commanded again You can get a sandwich at
the A B C

And Miss Purkiss arose and followed my relation which was the saddest
thing of all

As soon as they were well out of the room Mrs Torquilin turned
round I suppose youll wonder about the why and wherefore of all this
turnup she said to me her cheeks flushed and her eyes sparkling
Its a long story and Ill tell you another time But it comes to this
in the endthat creature and I married into the same family My husband
and the late John Portheris poor fellow were stepbrothers and that
old cat had the impudencebut theres no use going into it now All I
have to say is she generally meets her match when she meets me
Ill put up with no hankypanky work from Mrs Cummers Portheris my
dearand well she knows it

It was certainly nice of you to help me out of the difficulty Mrs
Torquilin I said for Id rather go anywhere than to Miss Purkisss
but Im sorry you had to

Tell a tarradiddle Not a bit of it my dearI meant it Two are
better than one any dayIve plenty of room in my little flat and if
you like to share the expenses Ill not object At all events we
can but try it and it will be showing very good feeling towards the
Maffertons Im not a great hand for junketing mind you but well
manage to amuse ourselves a littlea little giddygoating does nobody
any harm

Then I kissed Mrs Torquilin and she kissed me and I told her
how extremely obliged I was to her and asked her if she had really
considered it and Mrs Torquilin said wasnt it enough that I should
be left to that woman meaning my relation and that I should come
next day to see how we could best arrange matters And while I think
of it child here is my address my friend continued taking out her
cardcase and watching me very carefully with a little smile about her
mouth I looked at it I think my embarrassment gratified her a little
for the card read Lady Torquilin  Cadogan Mansions SW I didnt
know what to say And I had been calling a lady of title Mrs all this
time Still I reflected she would hardly have been so nice to me if
I had offended her very much and if she had been particular about her
title she could have mentioned it

It seems I said that I have been making a mistake I expected to
make mistakes in this country but Im sorry I began with you

Nonsense child she returned It was just my little jokeand I
made Charlie Mafferton keep it Theres precious little in the handle
I assure youexcept an extra halfcrown in ones bills And Lady
Torquilin gave me her hand to say goodbye

Goodbye I said I think handles are nice all the same And
thenit is an uncomfortable thing to write but it happenedI thought
of something I was determined to make no more mistakes if asking would
prevent it

Please tell me I said for you see I cant possibly knowam I to
call you your ladyship or my lady

Now dont talk rubbish said Lady Torquilin Youre to call me by my
name You are too quaint Be a good childand dont be late tomorrow





VIII

IF I only had my own house in Portman Street Lady Torquilin remarked
next day when we were having our tea in her flat I could make you a
great deal more comfy Here we are just a bit crampedcrowded as you
say in America But you cant eat your cake and have it too

Which have you done Lady Torquilin I inquired with your cake

Let it said my friendtwentyfive guineas a week my dear which is
something to a poor woman Last season it only brought twenty and cost
me a fortune to get it clean again after the pigs who lived in it For
the extra five I have to be thankful to the Duchess

Did you really let it to a Duchess I asked with deep interest How
lovely

Indeed I did not But the Duchess came to live round the corner
and rents went up in consequence You dont know what it means to
propertyowners in London to have a duchess living round the corner
my child It means everything Not that Im freehold in Portman
StreetIve only a lease and Lady Torquilin sighed This led
us naturally into matters of finance and we had a nice sensible
practical discussion about our joint expenses It doesnt matter to
anybody what our arrangement was but I must say that I found great
occasion for protest against its liberality towards me Nonsense said
Lady Torquilin invariably dont be a foolish kitten Its probably
less than you would pay at a good private hotelthats the advantage to
you Every time we take a hansom it will be only sixpence each instead
of a shillingthats the advantage to me and no small advantage it is
for cabs are my ruin And youll save me plenty of steps Im sure my
dear So there say no more about it but go and get your boxes

So I drove back to the Mtropole finally and as I locked my last trunk
I noticed a fresh card on the mantelpiece It was another of Mr Charles
Maffertons and on the back was written in pencil I hope you are
meeting with no difficulties Should be glad to be of use in any way
Please let me know your permanent address as soon as possible as the
mother and sisters would like to call upon youG M This was nice
and kind and friendly and I tried in vain to reconcile it with what I
had heard of English stiffness and exclusiveness and reserve I would
write to Mr Mafferton I thought that very night I supposed that by
the mother he meant his own but it struck me as a curious expression
In America we specify our parents and a reference to the mother there
would probably be held to refer back to Eve But in England you like all
kinds of distinguishing articles dont you

Lady Torquilins flat was a new one of the regular American kindnot a
second or third floor in an oldfashioned London houseand had a share
I am thankful to say in a primitive elevator The elevator was very
small but the man in the lower hall seemed to stand greatly in awe of
it To get them there boxes up in this ere lift miss he said when
I and my trunks presented ourselves shell ave to make three trips at
leastand he looked at me rather reproachfully Ware do you want
em put out I said Lady Torquilins flat Thats Number Four
he commented a good ways up If you wouldnt mind a hextra sixpence
miss I could get a man off the street to elp me with emthey do be a
size I said by all means and presently my impedimenta were ascending
with much deliberate circumstance one piece at a time The acoustic
properties of Cadogan Mansions are remarkable Standing at the foot of
that elevator encouraging its labours as it were I could not possibly
help overhearing Lady Torquilins reception of my trunks mingled with
the more subdued voices of her housemaids It was such a warm reception
expressed in such graphic terms that I thought I ought to be present
myself to acknowledge it and the man put on two ordinarysized valises
next to allow me to go up at the same time Weve got our orders
miss to be pertickeler about wot she carries miss he said when I
thought a trunk or two might accompany me You see if anything went
wrong with er works miss theres no sayin ware wed beand we
solemnly began to rise Ladies in the Mansions dont generally use the
lift such a very great deal he remarked further especially goin
down They complain of the sinkin

I shall always go up and down in it I said I dont mind the
sinking Im used to it

Very well miss You ave only to press the button and shell come up
an a great convenience youll find er miss he returned resignedly
unlocking the grated door on Lady Torquilins flat where my hostess
stood with her hands folded and two maids respectfully behind her
regarding the first instalment of my baggage After she had welcomed me
Its curiosity in its way said Lady Torquilin but whats to be done
with it the dear only knowsunless we sublet it It required some
strength of mind to tell her that there were two more coming up
The next one she called an abnormity and the third she called a
barnsimply And I must say my trunks did look imposing in Lady
Torquilins flat Finally however by the exercise of ingenuity on our
parts and muscle on the maids we got the whole of my baggage settled
up as Lady Torquilin expressed it and I was ready for my first
approved and endorsed experience in your metropolis

It came that afternoon I am going to take you said Lady Torquilin at
lunch to Mrs Fry Hamiltons at home She likes Americans and her
partiesfunctions as society idiots call itdisgusting wordare
generally rather swagger as they say I daresay youll enjoy it Make
yourself as tidy as possible mind Put on your pretty grey tuck in
that fringe of yours a bit too my dear and be ready by five sharp

Dont you like my bangs Lady Torquilin

Say your fringe child people dont bang in Englandexcept doors
and the piano No I cant say Im fond of it What were you given a
forehead for if you were not intended to show it I fancy I see Sir
Hector when he was alive allowing me to wear a fringe And Lady
Torquilin pushed my hair up in that fond cheerful heavyhanded way
people have that makes you back away nervously and feel yourself
a fright I went to my room wondering whether my affection for Lady
Torquilin would ever culminate in the sacrifice of my bangs I could not
say seriously that I felt equal to it then

We went to Mrs Fry Hamiltons in a hansomnot as Lady Torquilin said
that she had the least objection to omnibuses especially when they
didnt drop one at the very door but because there were no omnibuses
very convenient to the part of Cromwell Road that Mrs Fry Hamilton
lived in We inspected several before Lady Torquilin made a
selectionrubbertyred yellowwheeled with a horse attached that
would hardly stand still while we got in I was acutely miserable he
went so fast but Lady Torquilin liked it Hes perfectly fresh poor
darling she said It breaks my heart to drive behind a wretched
wornout creature with its head down I said Yes I thought he was
very fresh indeed and asked Lady Torquilin if she noticed how he
waggled his head Dear beastie she replied hes got a sore mouth
Suppose your mouth were perfectly raw and you had a bit in it and a
man tugging at the reins But I couldnt stand it any longer I put
my parasol up through the door in the top

 Make him stop waggling I called to the driver Its only a little abit of is miss the driver said and then as the horse dropped his pace he whipped him Instantly Lady Torquilins parasol admonished him If you flog your horse she said emphatically I get out I dont think I have ever driven in a hansom with Lady Torquilin since that our parasols have not both gone through the roof to point statements like these to the cabman Lady Torquilin usually anguished on the dear horses account and I unhappy on my own It enlivens the most monotonous drive but it is a great strain on the nerves I generally beg for a fourwheeler instead but Lady Torquilin is contemptuous of fourwheelers and declares she would just as soon drive in the British Museum She says I will get used to it if I will only abstract my mind and talk about something else and I am trying but the process is a very painful one

When we arrived at Mrs Fry Hamiltons I rang the bell

Bless you child said Lady Torquilin thats not the way Theyll
take you for a nursery governess or a pianotuner or a bill This
is the proper thing for visitors And with that Lady Torquilin rapped
sonorously and rang a pealsuch a rap and peal as I had never heard
in all my life before In America we have only one kind of ring for
everybodyfrom the mayor of the city to the man who sells plaster
Cupids and will take old clothes on account We approach each others
doorbells as a nation with much greater deference and there is a
certain humility in the way we introduce our personalities anywhere

I felt uncomfortable on Mrs Fry Hamiltons doorstep as if I were not
individually worth all that noise Since then I have been obliged to
rap and ring myself because Lady Torquilin likes me to be as proper
as I can but there is always an incompleteness about the rap and an
ineffectualness about the ring I simply havent the education to do
it And when the footman opens the door I feel that my face expresses
deprecatingly Its only me Rap and ring says Lady Torquilin
deridingly its a tap and tinkle Lady Torquilin is fond of
alliteration

Inside quite a few people were ascending and descending a narrow
staircase that climbed against the wall taking up as little room as
it could and a great many were in the room on the groundfloor where
refreshments were being dispensed They were all beautifully dressedif
I have learned anything in England it is not to judge the English
by the clothes they wear in Americaand they moved about with great
precision making as a general thing that pleasant rustle which
we know to mean a silk foundation The rustle was the only form of
conversation that appeared to be general but I noticed speaking going
on in several groups of two or three And I never saw better going up
and down stairsit was beautifully done even by ladies weighing I
should think quite two hundred pounds apiece which you must reduce to
stun for yourself Lady Torquilin led the way with great simplicity
and directness into the diningroom and got tea for us both from one of
the three whitecapped modestlyexpressionless maids behind the
tableI cannot tell you what a dream of peace your servants are in
this countryand asked me whether I would have spongecake or a
cress sandwich or what But I said where is Mrs Fry HamiltonI
havent been introduced

All in good time said Lady Torquilin Its just as well to take our
tea when we can get itwe wont be able to turn round in here in half
an hourand Lady Torquilin took another sandwich with composure Try
the plumcake she advised me in an aside BuszardI can tell at a
glance I have to deny myself

And I tried the plumcake but with a sense of guilty apprehension
lest Mrs Fry Hamilton should appear in the doorway and be naturally
surprised at the consumption of her refreshments by an utter stranger
I noticed that almost everybody else did the same thing and that nobody
seemed at all nervous but I occupied as much of Lady Torquilins shadow
as I could all the same and on the way up implored her saying
Have I any crumbs I felt that it would require more hardihood than
I possessed to face Mrs Fry Hamilton with shreds of her substance
acquired before I knew her clinging to my person But concealment was
useless and seemed to be unnecessary

Have you had any tea said Mrs Fry Hamilton to Lady Torquilin her
question embracing us both as we passed before her and Lady Torquilin
said Yes thanks as nonchalantly as possible

Lady Torquilin had just time to say that I was an American

Really remarked Mrs Fry Hamilton looking at me again How nice
The only one I have today I think And we had to make room for
somebody else But it was then that the curious sensation of being
attached to a string and led about which I have felt more or less in
London ever since occurred to me firstin the statement that I was the
only one Mrs Fry Hamilton had today

Lady Torquilin declared as she looked round the room that she didn t
see a soul she knew so we made our way to a corner and sat down and
began to talk in those uninterested spasms that always attack people
who come with each other PresentlyThere is that nice little Mrs
PastelleJones said Lady Torquilin I must go and speak to herand
I was left alone with the opportunity of admiring the china I dont
wonder at your fondness for it in London drawingrooms It seems to be
the only thing that you can keep clean So many people were filing in
past Mrs Fry Hamilton however that the china soon lost its interest
for me The people were chiefly ladiesan impressive number of old
stout rosy whitehaired ladies in black who gave me the idea of
remarkable health at their age more middleaged ones rather inclined
to be pale and thin with narrow cheekbones and higharched noses and
sweet expressions and a great deal of black lace and jet much puffed
on the shoulders and young ones who were of course the very first
English young ladies I had ever seen in an English drawingroom I
suppose you are accustomed to them you dont know what they were
to meyou couldnt understand the intense interest and wonder and
admiration they excited in me I had never seen anything human so tall
and strong and fine and freshcoloured before with such clear limpid
eyes such pretty red lips and the outward showing of such excellent
appetites It seemed to me that everyone was an epitome of her early
years of breadandbutter and milk puddings and going to bed at
halfpast nine and the epitomes had a charming similarity The English
young lady stood before me in Mrs Fry Hamiltons drawingroom as an
extraordinary productin almost all cases fiveeight and in some quite
six feet in height Her little mamma was dwarfed beside her and when
she smiled down upon the occasional man who was introduced to her in
her tall compassionate way he looked quite insignificant even if he
carried the square turnedback shoulders by which I have learned to
tell military men in this country We have nothing like it in America
on the same scale although we have a great deal more air to breathe and
vegetables to eat than you I knew that I had always been considered
a big girl but beside these firmfleshed young women I felt myself
rather a poor creature without a muscular advantage to my name They
smiled a good deal but I did not see them talk muchit seemed enough
for them to be and they had a considering air as if things were new to
them and they had not quite made up their minds And as they considered
they blushed a good deal in a way that was simply sweet As I sat
musing upon them I saw Lady Torquilin advancing toward me with one
of the tallest pinkest bestdeveloped and most tailormade of all
immediately behind her following with her chin outstretched a little
and her eyes downcast and a pretty expression of doing what she was
told

My dear said Lady Torquilin this is Miss Gladys Fortescue
GladysMiss Wick my young lady friend from Chicago Miss Fortescue has
a brother in America so you will have something to chat about

Howdjdo said Miss Fortescue She said it very quickly with a
sweet smile and an interesting little mechanical movement of the head
blushing at the same time and we shook hands That is I think one of
us did though I cant say positively which one it was As I remember
the process there were two shakes but they were not shakes that ran
into each other and one of themI think it was minefailed to come
off as you say in tennis Mine was the shake that begins nowhere in
particular and ends without your knowing itjust the ordinary American
shake arranged on the muscular system in common use with us Miss
Fortescues was a rapid convulsive movement that sprang from her
shoulder and culminated with a certain violence There was a little push
in it too and it exploded as it were high in air At the same time I
noticed the spectacles of a small man who stood near very much in peril
from Miss Fortescues elbow Then I remembered and understood the sense
of dislocation I had experienced after shaking hands with Mrs Fry
Hamilton and which I had attributed in the confusion of the moment to
being held up so to speak as an American

Do you know my brother said Miss Fortescue

I am afraid not I replied Where does he live

In the United States said Miss Fortescue He went out there six
months ago with a friend Perhaps you know his friendMr Colfax

I said I knew two or three Mr Colfaxes but none of them were
Englishhad not been at least for some time back and did Miss
Fortescue know what particular part of the Union her brother and his
friend had gone to You know I said we have an area of three
million square miles I daresay I mentioned our area with a certain
pardonable pride Its a thing we generally make a point of in America

I shouldnt have thought there was anything particularly humorous in
an area but Miss Fortescue laughed prettily I remember learning that
from my governess she said My brother is out in the Westeither
in the town of Minneapolis and the State of Minnesota or the town of
Minnesota and the State of Minneapolis I never know without looking
out his address which comes first But I daresay there are a good many
people in the United Statesyou might easily miss him

We have sixty millions Miss Fortescue I said and Miss Fortescue
returned that in that case she didnt see how we could be expected to
know anybody and after that the conversation flagged for a few seconds
during which we both looked at the other people

I have never been to America Miss Fortescue said I should like to
go Is it very cold

I did not mention the area again In some places I said

I should not like that But then you have the toebeganingthat must
be nice

I assented though I did not in the least know until Miss Fortescue
spoke of skating what she meant Miss Fortescue thought the skating
must be nice too and then she supposed though it was cold we
always went out prepared for it And the conversation flagged again
Fortunately a gentleman at the other end of the room where the piano
was began at that moment to sing something very pleading and lamentable
and uncomfortable with a burden of I love thee so which generally
rhymed with woean address to somebody he called Dearrr
Hearrrt as high as he could reach turning up his eyes a good deal
as if he were in pain And for the time it was not necessary to talk

When he had finished Miss Fortescue asked me if it was not delightful
and I said it wasdid she know the gentlemans name Miss Fortescue
said she did not but perhaps Lady Torquilin would And then just as
Lady Torquilin came up How do you like England asked Miss Fortescue



Well asked Lady Torquilin as we drove home in another hansom what
did you and Gladys Fortescue find to say to each other

I said quite truly that I did not remember at the moment but I
admired Miss Fortescuealso with great sincerityso enthusiastically
that I daresay Lady Torquilin thought we had got on splendidly together

And what I wonder is if Miss Fortescue had been asked about our
conversation what she would have said





IX

YOU are sure you know where youre going said Lady Torquilin
referring to the Army and Navy Victoria omnibus remember at
Sloanesquare a penny fare and not more mind You must learn to look
after your pennies Now what are you to do for me at the Stores

A packet of light Silurian your camphor and aconite pilules to ask
how long they intend to be over the valise theyre fixing for you

Portmanteau theyre recovering Yes go on

And what their charge is for cleaning red curtains

And to complain about the candles added Lady Torquilin

And to complain about the candles

Yes Dont forget about the candles dear See what theyll do And Im
very sorry I cant go with you to Madame Tussauds but you know Ive
been trotting about the whole morning and all those wax people with
their idiotic expressions this afternoon would simply finish me off
Ill just lie down a bit and go with you another day I couldnt
stand up much longer to talk to the Queen herself You pop into the
Underground you know at St Jamess Park and out at Baker Street
Now where do you pop inand out Thats quite right Goodbye child
I rang for the lift to come up a quarter of an hour ago its probably
there now and we mustnt keep it waiting Off you go But the
elevatordoor was locked and our descent had begun when Lady Torquilin
hurried along the passage arrested and kept it waiting on her own
account Its only to say dear she called through the grating that
you are on no consideration whatever to get in or out of an Underground
train while it is moving On no consideration what but the grating
slowly disappeared and the rest of Lady Torquilins admonition came
down on the top of the elevator

I had done every one of the commissions I had been magisterially raised
and lowered from one floor to another to find that everything I wanted
was situated up and down so many staircases and turn to your right
madam that I concluded they kept an elevator at the Stores for
pleasure I had had an agreeable interview with a very blonde young
druggist upon the pilules in the regions above and had made it all
right with a man in muttonchop whiskers and an apron about the candles
in the regions below I had seen a thing I had never seen in my life
before a very curious thing that interested me enormouslya husband
and father buying his wifes and daughters drygoodsprobably Lady
Torquilin would tell me to say dress materials In America our
husbands and fathers are too much occupied to make purchases for their
families for which it struck me that we had never been thankful enough
I will not have you in stripes I heard him say as I passed full of
commiseration for her What arrogance I thought In America they are
glad to have us in anything And I rejoiced that it was so

But as I was saying I had done all Lady Torquilins commissions and
was making my last trip to the groundfloor with the old soldier in the
elevator when a gentleman got in at one of the stoppingplaces and
sat down opposite me He had that look of deliberate indifference that
I have noticed so many English gentlemen carry about with themas
if although they are bodily present their interest in life had been
carefully put away at homeand he concentrated his attention upon
the point of his umbrella just as he used to do upon the saltcellars
crossing the Atlantic Ocean And he looked up almost with astonishment
when I said How do you do Mr Mafferton rather as if he did not
quite expect to be spoken to in an elevator by a young lady Miss Wick
he said and we shook hands as the old soldier let us out How very
odd I was on the point of looking you up at Lady Torquilins You see
Ive found you out at lastno thanks to youafter looking all over the
place

There was a very definite reproach in this so I told Mr Mafferton
as we went down the steps that I was extremely sorry he had taken any
trouble on my account that I had fully intended to write to him in
the course of a day or two but he had no idea how much time it took
up getting settled in a flat where the elevator ran only at stated
intervals But I said with some curiosity how did you find me out
Mr Mafferton For if there is one interesting thing it is to discover
how an unexpected piece of information about yourself has been come by

Lady Torquilin dropped me a line replied Mr Mafferton that is
she mentioned it inin a note yesterday Lady Torquilin Mr Mafferton
went on is a very old friend of mineand an awfully good sort as I
daresay you are beginning to find out

By this time we had reached the pavement and were standing in
everybodys way with the painful indetermination that attacks people
who are not quite sure whether they ought to separate or not Ansom
cab sir asked one of the porters No said Mr Mafferton I was
on the very point he went on to me dodging a boy with a bandbox of
going to offer my services as cicerone this afternoon if you and Lady
Torquilin would be good enough to accept them

Ansom cab sir asked another porter as Mr Mafferton getting out
of the way of a resplendent footman upset a small child with a topheavy
bonnet belonging to the lady who belonged to the footman

Original No said Mr Mafferton in quite a temper Shall we get out of this he asked me appealingly and we walked on in the direction of the Houses of Parliament Theres nothing on in particular that I know of he continued but there are always the stock shows and Lady Torquilin is up to any amount of sightseeing I know

She isnt today Mr Mafferton Shes lying down I did my best to
persuade her to come out with me and she wouldnt But Im going
sightseeing this very minute and if you would like to come too Im
sure I shall be very glad

Mr Mafferton looked a little uncomfortable Where were you thinking of
going he asked

To Madame Tussauds I said You go by the Underground Railway
from here Get in at St Jamess Park Station and out at Baker Street
Stationabout twentyfive minutes in the cars And you are not
I said remembering what I had been told under any consideration
whatever to get in or out of the train while it is moving

Mr Mafferton laughed Lady Torquilin has been coaching you he said
but he still looked uncomfortable and thinking he felt perhaps like
an intruder upon my plans and wishing to put him at his ease I said
It would really be very kind of you to come Mr Mafferton for even at
school I never could remember English history and now Ive probably got
your dynasties worse mixed up than ever It would be a great advantage
to go with somebody who knows all the dates and which kings usurped
their thrones and who they properly belonged to

Mr Mafferton laughed again I hope you dont expect all that of me
he said But if you are quite sure we couldnt rout Lady Torquilin out
I will take you to Madame Tussauds with the greatest pleasure Miss
Wick

Im quite sure I told Mr Mafferton cheerfully She said all those
wax people with their idiotic expressions this afternoon would simply
finish her upand Mr Mafferton said Lady Torquilin put things very
quaintly didnt she And we went together into one of those great
echoing caverns in the sides of the streets that led down flights of
dirty steps past the man who punches the tickets and widen out into
that border of desolation with a fierce star burning and brightening in
the blackness of the farther end which is a platform of the Underground
Railway

This said I to Mr Mafferton as we walked up and down waiting for our
train is one of the things I particularly wanted to see

The penny weighingmachine asked Mr Mafferton for I had stopped to
look at that

The whole thing said Ithe Underground system But this is
interesting in itself I added putting a penny in and stepping on the
machine

 Please hold my parasol Mr Mafferton so that I may get the exact truth for my penny Mr Mafferton took the parasol with a slightly clouded expression which deepened when one of two gentlemen who had just come on the platform bowed to him I think if you dont mind Miss Wick we had better go farther along the platformit will be easier to get the carriage he said in a manner which quite dashed my amiable intention of telling him how even the truth was cheaper in this country than in America for our weighingmachines wouldnt work for less than a nickel which was twice and ahalf as much as a penny Just then however the train came whizzing in we bundled ourselves into a compartment the door banged after us with frightful explosivenessthe Underground bang is a thing which I should think the omnibus companies had great cause to be thankful forand we went with a scream and a rush into the black unknown It seemed to me in the first few minutes that life as I had been accustomed to it had lapsed and that a sort of semiconscious existence was filling up the gap between what had been before and what would be again I cant say I found this phase of being agreeable It occurred to me that my eyes and my ears and my lungs might just as well have been left at home The only organ that found any occupation was my noseall sense seemed concentrated in that sharpedged objectionable smell What do you think of the Underground said Mr Mafferton leaning across above the rattle

I told him I hadnt had time to analyse my impressions in a series of
shrieks and subsided to watch for the greyness of the next station
After that had passed and I was convinced that there were places where
you could escape to the light and air of the outside world again I
asked Mr Mafferton a number of questions about the railway and in
answering them he said the first irritating thing I heard in England
I hope he remarked that your interest in the Underground wont take
you all the way round the Circle to see what its like

Why do you hope that Mr Mafferton I said Is it dangerous

Not in the least he returned a little confusedly Onlymost
Americans like to make the entire circuit I believe

Ive no doubt they want to see how bad it can be I said We are a
very fair nation Mr Mafferton But though I cant understand your hope
in the matter I dont think it likely I shall travel by Underground any
more than I can help Because for the moment I felt an annoyance Why
should Mr Mafferton hope about my conductMr Mafferton was not
my maiden aunt But he very politely asked me how I thought it compared
with the Elevated in New York and I was obliged to tell him that I
really didnt think it compared at all The Elevated was ugly to look
at and some people found it giddy to ride on but it took you through
the best quality of air and sunlight the entire distance and if
anything happened at all events you could see what it was Mr
Mafferton replied that he thought he preferred the darkness to looking
through other peoples windows and this preference of Mr Maffertons
struck me later as being interestingly English And after that we both
lapsed into meditation and I thought about old London with its Abbey
and its Tower and its Houses of Parliament and its Bluecoat boys
and its monuments and its ten thousand hansom cabs lying just over my
head and an odd pleasurable sensation of undermining the centuries and
playing a trick with history almost superseded the Underground smell
The more I thought about it and about what Mr Mafferton had said the
more I liked that feeling of taking an enormous liberty with London
and by the time we reached Baker Street Station I was able to say to Mr
Mafferton with a clear conscience in spite of my smuts and halftorpid
state of mind that on consideration I thought I would like to compass
London by the Undergroundto make the entire circuit

Original T struck me from the outside as oddly imposingMadame Tussauds Partly I suppose because it is always more or less treated jocosely partly because of the homely little familiar name and partly because a persons expectations of a waxwork show are naturally not very lofty I was looking out for anything but a swelling dome and a flag and the high brick walls of an Institution There seemed a grotesqueness of dignity about it which was emphasised by the solemn man at the turnstile who took the shillings and let us through and by the spaciousness insideemphasised so much that it disappeared so to speak and I found myself taking the place quite seriouslythe gentleman in tin on the charger in the main hall below and the wide marble stairs and the urns in the corners and the oil paintings on the landings and everything I began asking Mr Mafferton questions immediately quite in the subdued voice people use under impressive circumstances but he wasnt certain who the architect was and couldnt say where the marble came from and really didnt know how many years the waxworks had been in existence and hadnt the least idea what the gross receipts were per annumdid not in fact seem to think he ought to be expected to be acquainted with these matters The only thing he could tell me definitely was that Madame Tussaud was deadand I knew that myself Upon my word you know said Mr Mafferton I havent been here since I was put into knickers I was surprised at this remark when I heard it for Mr Mafferton was usually elegant to a degree in his choice of terms but I should not be now I have found nothing plainer in England than the language Its simplicity and directness are a little startling at first perhaps to the foreign ear but this soon wears off as you become accustomed to it and I dare say the foreigner begins to talk the same wayin which case my speech will probably be a matter of grave consideration to me when I get back to Chicago In America we usually put things in a manner somewhat more involved Yes I know you are thinking of the old story about Americans draping the legs of their pianos but if I were you I would discount that story For my own part I never in my life saw it done

The moment we were inside the main hall where the orchestra was
playing before I had time to say more than How very interesting Mr
Mafferton Who is that and why is he famous Mr Mafferton bought one
of the red and gilt and green catalogues from the young woman at the
door and put it into my hand almost impulsively

I fancy theyre very completeand reliable Miss Wick he said
Youyou really mustnt depend upon me Its such an unconscionable
time since I left school

I told Mr Mafferton I was sure that was only his modest way of putting
it and that I knew he had reams of English history in his head if he
would only just think of it and he replied No really upon my word
I have not But by that time I realised that I was in the immediate
society of all the remarkable old kings and queens of England and the
emotions they inspired standing round in that promiscuous touchable
way with their crowns on occupied me so fully that for at least ten
minutes I found it quite interesting enough to look at them in silence
So I sat down on one of the seats in the middle of the hall where
people were listening to the orchestras selections from The
Gondoliers and gave myself up to the curious captivation of the
impression Its not bad said Mr Mafferton reflectively a little
way off No I said its beautiful But I think he meant the
selections and I meant the kings and queens to whom he was not paying
the slightest attention But I did not find fault with him for thathe
had been in a manner brought up amongst these things he lived in a
country that always had a king or queen of some sort to rule over it
he was used to crowns and sceptres He could not possibly have the
same feelings as a person born in Chicago and reared upon Republican
principles But to me those quaint groups of royalties in the robes and
jewels of other times and arrayed just as much in their characters as
in their clothesthe characters everybody knows them bywere a
source of pure and while I sat there increasing delight I dont mind
confessing that I like the kings and queens at Madame Tussauds better
than anything else Ive seen in England at the risk of being considered
a person of low intelligence I know that Mr James Russell Lowellwhom
poppa always used to say he was proud to claim as a fellowcountryman
until he went Mugwump when Cleveland was electedsaid of them that they
were much like any other English party but I should think from that
that Mr Lowell was perhaps a little prejudiced against waxworks and
intolerant of the form of art which they represent or possibly when
he said it he had just come to London and had not attended many English
parties For it seems to me that the peculiar charm and interest of the
ladies and gentlemen at Madame Tussauds is the ingenuous earnestness
with which they show you their temperaments and tastes and dispositions
which I have not found especially characteristic of other English ladies
and gentlemen As Lady Torquilin says however thats as it may be
All I know is that whatever Mr Lowell from his lofty Harvard standard
of culture may find to say in deprecation of all that is left of your
early sovereigns I from my humble Chicago point of view was immensely
pleased with them I could not get over the feelingI have not got over
it yetthat they were or at any rate had once been veritable kings
and queens I had a sentiment of respect I could not think of them
as I told Mr Mafferton as wax and it never occurred to me that
the crowns were brass and the jewels glass Even now I find that an
unpleasant reflection and I would not go back to Madame Tussauds on
any account for fear the brassiness of the crowns and the glassiness
of the jewels might obtrude themselves the second time and spoil the
illusion English history with its moated castles and knights in
armour and tyrant kings and virtuous queens had always seemed more
or less of a fairy tale to meit is difficult to believe in medival
romance in Americaand there about me was the fairy tale realised
all the curious old people who died of a surfeit of lampreys or of
a bad temper or of decapitation or in other ways which would be
considered eccentric now in all their dear old folds and fashions
red and blue and gold and ermine with their crowns on There was a
sociability among them too that I thought interesting and that struck
me as a thing I shouldnt have expected some of their characters being
so very good and some so very bad but I suppose being all kings and
queens any other distinction would be considered invidious I looked up
while I was thinking about them and caught Mr Mafferton yawning

Are you impressed he said disguising it with a smile

Very much I answered him In a way Arent you I think theyre
imbecile said Mr Mafferton Imbecile old Things I have been
wondering what they could possibly suggest to you

Mr Mafferton certainly spoke in that way I remember it distinctly
Because I depended upon it in taking as we went round a certain
freedom of criticismdepended upon it I had reason to believe
afterwards unwarrantably

Let us look at them individually I said rising Collectively I
find them lovable

Well now I envy them replied Mr Mafferton with great coolness
This was surprisingly frivolous in Mr Mafferton who was usually quite
what would be called a serious person and just for a minute I did not
quite know what to say Then I laughed a little frivolously too I
suppose you intend that for a compliment Mr Mafferton I said
Privately I thought it very clumsy This is Number One I thinkand
we stopped before William the Conqueror asking Matilda of Flanders to
sit down

I dont know that I did said Mr Maffertonwhich made the situation
awkward for me for if there is an uncomfortable thing it is to
appropriate a compliment which was not intended An Englishman is a
being absolutely devoid of tact

So this is William the Conqueror I said by way of changing the
subject

 It may be a little like his clothes said Mr Mafferton indifferently

Oh dont say that Mr Mafferton Im sure he looks every inch a
William the Conqueror See how polite he is to his wife tooI suppose
thats because hes French

Mr Mafferton didnt say anything and it occurred to me that perhaps I
had not expressed myself well

Do you notice I went on how he wears his crownall tipped to one
side He reminds me just a little Mr Mafferton with that type of
faceenterprising you knowand hair that length only it ought to
be dark and if the crown were only a widebrimmed soft felt hathe
reminds mo very much of those Californian ranchers and miners Bret Harte
and Joaquin Miller write about

Do you mean cowboys asked Mr Mafferton in a way that told me he
wasnt going to agree with me

Yes that kind of person I think William the Conqueror would make a
beautiful cowboya regular Terror of the Canyon

Cant say I see it said Mr Mafferton fixing his eye upon the bass
cello at the other end of the room

It isnt in that direction I said and Mr Mafferton became
exceedingly red Then it occurred to me that possibly over here that
might be considered impertinent so I did my best to make up for it
A very nice face isnt it I went on What is he particularly noted
for Mr Mafferton besides the Curfew and the Doomsday Book and
introducing old families into England

Mr Mafferton bit his moustache I had never seen anybody bite his
moustache before though I had always understood from novels that it
was done in England Whether American gentlemen have better tempers or
whether they are afraid of injuring it or why the habit is not a common
one with us I am unable to say

Really Miss Wick Mr Mafferton responded with six degrees of frost
Iis there nothing about it in the catalogue He established the only
date which would ever stick in my memory But you mustnt think he
brought all the old families in England over with him Miss Wickit is
incorrect

I daresay I said people get such curious ideas about England in
America Mr Mafferton But that did not seem to please Mr Mafferton
either I think they ought to know he said so seriously that I
did not like to retaliate with any English misconceptions of American
matters And from what I know of Mr Mafferton now I do not think he
would have seen the slightest parallel

How this brings it all back I said as we looked at William the
Second surnamed Rufus in blue and yellow with a plain frontthe
marks in history at school and the dates let in at the sides of the
pages His dead body with an arrow sticking in it was found by
Purkiss a charcoalburner and carried in a cart to Winchester where
it was buried in the Cathedral I remember I used to torment myself by
wondering whether they pulled the arrow out because in my history it
didnt say they did

Its a fact said Mr Mafferton one always does think of the old
chap with the arrow sticking in him BurneJones or one of those
fellows ought to paint itthe forest you know twilight and the
charcoalburner in a state of funk Tremendously effectivethough I
daresay its been done scores of times

And sold to be lithographed in advertisements I added

Ah Miss Wick that is the utilitarian American way of looking at
things Mr Mafferton remarked jocularly and I dont think I could
have been expected to refrain from telling him that I had in mind a
certain soap not manufactured in America

When we got as far as Henry the Second Curtmantle whom Madame Tussaud
describes as a wise and good king and who certainly has an amiable
open countenance I noticed that all the crowns were different and
asked Mr Mafferton about itwhether at that time every king had his
crown made to order and trimmed according to his own ideas or had to
take whatever crown was going and whether it was his to do as he liked
with or went with the throne and if the majority of the kings had
behaved properly about their crowns and where they all were But if Mr
Mafferton knew he chose to be equivocalhe did not give me any answer
that I feel I could rely upon sufficiently to put into print Then we
passed that nice brave crusading Richard the First surnamed Coeur
de Lion in some domestic argument with his sweet Berengaria and Mr
Mafferton talking about her used the expression Fair flower of
Navarre But at that time he was carrying the catalogue

King John I thought delightful I could not have believed it possible
to put such a thoroughly bad temper into wax and I said so to Mr
Mafferton who agreed with me though without enthusiasm The worst
king who ever sat on the English throne I repeated meditatively
quoting from Madame Tussaudthats saying a great deal isnt it Mr
Mafferton My escort said No he couldnt say he thought it represented
such an acme of wickedness and we walked on past swarthy little sad
Charles the Second in armour and lace who looksand how could he
help itas if he were always thinking of what happened to his sireI
suppose the expression poppa is unknown among royalties Mr Mafferton
would not agree to this either he seemed to have made up his mind not
to agree to anything further

I should like to write a whole chapter about Henry the Eighth as he
looked that day though I daresay it is an habitual expression and you
may have seen it often yourself He was standing in the midst of a
group of ladies including some of his wives stepping forward in an
impulsive emotional way listening with grief in both his eyes to the
orchestras rendition of



Bury Bury Let the grave close oer



as if deeply deprecating the painful necessity of again becoming a
widower It was beautiful to see the way the music worked upon his
feelings It will be impossible for me ever to think so badly of him
again

What is your impression of him asked Mr Mafferton

I said I thought he was too funny for words

He was a monster my friend remarked and you are quite the first
person I should say who has ever discovered anything humorous in him
And I gathered from Mr Maffertons tone that while it was pardonable
to think badly of an English monarch it was improper to a degree to
find him amusing

Then I observed that they were all listening with Henry the
EighthPhilippa of Hainault with her pink nose and the Black Prince in
mail and Catharine of Arragon embracing her monkey and Cardinal Wolsey
in red and Caxton in black and Chaucer in poets grey listening
intentlyyou could tell even by their reflections in the glassas the
orchestra went on



The days that have been and never shall be more



Personally I felt sorry for them all even for that old maid in armour
James the Second Mr Mafferton by the way could see nothing in the
least oldmaidish about this sovereign They must have had as a rule
such a very good time while it lastedit must have been so thoroughly
disagreeable to die I wanted immensely to ask Mr Maffertonbut
somehow his manner did not encourage me to do itwhether in those
very early times kings were able to wear their crowns every day without
exciting comment as Madame Tussaud distinctly gives you the idea that
they did And it seemed to me that in those days it must have been
really worth while to be a king and be different from other people
in both dress and deportment I would not go through the other rooms
because I did not believe anything could be more beautiful than the
remains of your early sovereigns and moreover Mr Mafferton was
getting so very nearly sulky that I thought I had better not But just
through the door I caught a glimpse of one or two American Presidents
in black with white ties They had intelligent faces but beside your
Plantagenets I dont mind confessing they didnt look anything





XI

I HAD not the least expectation of being fortunate enough to see your
Parliament open having always heard that all the peeresses wanted to go
on that occasion and knowing how little sitting accommodation you had
for anybody Americans find nothing more impressive in England than the
difficulty of getting a look at your system of governmentour own is so
very accessible to everyone who chooses to study it and to come and sit
in the general gallery of the House of Congress or the Senate without
making a disturbance The thing an American tells first and with
most pride when he comes home after visiting England is that he has
attended a sitting of Parliament and seen Mr Gladstone if he has heard
your veteran politician speak he is prouder still So I had cherished
the hope of somehow getting into the House while Parliament was in
session and seeing all the people we read so much about at home in
connection with the Irish Questionit was the thing I believe I had
set my heart upon doing most but tickets for the opening of Parliament
from Mr Mafferton with a note informing Lady Torquilin that his cousin
had promised to look after us on the occasion represented more than my
highest aspiration

Lady Torquilin was pleased too though I dont think she intended
to express her pleasure when she said with an air of philosophical
acceptance of whatever Fate might send Providence only knows my dear
how the old man will behave He may be as agreeable as possibleas
merry as a grigand he may be in a temper like the and Lady
Torquilin compressed her lips and nodded her head in a way that told me
how her remark would finish if she were not a member of the Church of
England rather low and a benefactor to deepsea fishermen and Dr
Barnardo with a strong objection to tobacco in any form We must
avoid subjects that are likely to provoke him local selfgovernment for
Ireland has given him apoplexy twice Ive heard of his getting awful
tantrums about this last Licensing Bill and marriage with a deceased
wifes sister I know is a thing to avoid

Then it dawned upon me that this was Mr Maffertons cousin who was a
lord and I had a very great private satisfaction that I should see what
he was like

I remember I said This is the cousin that you said was an old

Brute Lady Torquilin finished for me seeing that I didnt quite like
to So he is when hes in a rage I wouldnt be Lady Mafferton poor
dear for something An ordinary K and an ordinary temper for me I
asked Lady Torquilin what she meant by an ordinary K and in the next
halfhour I got a lesson on the various distinctions of the English
aristocracy that interested me extremely Lady Torquilins K I may
say while I am talking about it was the CMG kind and not the
K sometimes conferred late in life upon illustrious butchers Lady
Torquilin didnt seem to think much of this kind of K but I was glad
to hear of it It must be a great encouragement to honesty and industry
in the humbler walks of life or as you would say among the masses
and though I suppose it wouldnt exactly accord with our theory of
government I am sorry we have nothing even remotely like it in America

It was a nice day a lovely day an extraordinary day the February
day Lady Torquilin and I compromised upon a hansom and drove to the
Parliament buildings A person has such a vivid distinct recollection
of nice days in London The drive knocked another of my preconceived
ideas to piecesthe idea that Westminster was some distance off
and would have to be reached by trainnot quite so far perhaps as
Washington is from New York for that would just as likely as not put it
in the sea but a considerable distance I suppose you will think that
inexcusable but it is very difficult to be enough interested in foreign
capitals to verify vague impressions about them and Westminster is a
largesounding name that suggests at least a mayor and a town council
of its own It was odd to find it about twenty minutes from anywhere
in Loudon and not to know exactly when you had arrived until the cab
rolled under the shadow of the Abbey and stopped in the crowd that
waited to cheer the great politicians Lady Torquilin immediately
asked one of the policemen which way to goI dont know anybody who
appreciates what you might call the encyclopaedic value of the London
police more that Lady Torquilinand he waved us on Straight ahead
madame and turn in at the orseback statyou he said genially the
distance being not more than two hundred yards from where we stood and
the turningin point visible On the way notwithstanding Lady Torquilin
asked two other policemen My friend loves the peace of mind that
follows absolute certainty Presently we were following the rustling
elegance of two or three tall ladies whom I at once pronounced to be
peeresses through the broad quiet red corridor that leads to the
House of Lords

We were among the very first and had our choice of the long narrow
seats that run along the wall in a terrace on each side of the Chamber
Fortunately Lady Torquilin had attended other openings of Parliament
and knew that we must sit on the left otherwise we might just as likely
as not have taken our places on the other side where there were only
two or three old gentlemen with sticks and silk hatswhich I reflected
afterwards would have been awful But as it happened we sat down very
decorously in our proper places and I tried to realise as we looked at
the crowded galleries and the long narrow solemn crimson room with the
thronechair at one end that I was in the British House of Lords Our
Senate just before the opening of Congress is so very different Most
of the senators are greyhaired and many of them are bald but they all
walk about quite nimbly and talk before the proceedings begin with
a certain vivacity and there are pages running round with notes and
documents and a great many excited groups in the lobbies and a general
air of crisp business and alacrity everywhere The only thing I could
feel in the House of Lords that morning was a concentrated atmospheric
essence of Importance I was thinking of a thing Senator Ingalls said to
me two years ago which was what you would call comic when the idea
struck me that it was almost time for Parliament to open and not a
single peer had arrived So I asked Lady Torquilin when the lords might
be expected to come in Up to this time we had been discussing the
millinery by which we were surrounded

I daresay there wont be many today said Lady Torquilin Certainly
very few so far

Are there any here I asked her

Oh yesjust opposite dont you see child That wellsetup man with
the nice wholesome face the third from the end in the second row from
the bottomthats Lord Rosebery and next him is the great beermanI
forget his title and here is Lord Mafferton nowdont lookcoming
into the first row from the bottom and leaning over to shake hands with
Lord Rosebery

Tell me when I can look I said because I want to awfully But Lady
Torquilin are those peers They look very respectable and nice Im
sure but I did expect more in the way of clothes Where are their
flowing mantles and their chains and swords and things

Only when the Queen opens Parliament in person said Lady Torquilin
Then there is a turnout Now you can look at Lord Maffertonthe rude
old man Fancy his having the impudence to sit there with his hat on

I looked at Lord Mafferton who certainly had not removed his hatthe
large round shiny silk hat worn by every gentleman in England and
every commercial traveller in America Under the hat he was very pink
and fat with rather a snubby nose and little twinkling blue eyes and
a suggestion of white whisker about the place where his chin and his
cheek disappeared into his neck He wore lavenderkid gloves and was
inclined to corpulency I should not have trusted this description of
a peer of your realm if it had come from any other American pen than
my ownI should have set it down as a gross exaggeration due to envy
from the fact that we can neither produce peers in our own country nor
keep them there for any length of time but I was obliged to believe
my own eyes and that is the way they reported Lord Mafferton from the
other side of your Upper House There were other gentlemen in the rows
oppositegentlemen all in black and gentlemen in light waistcoats
bearded and cleanshaven most of them elderly but a few surprisingly
middleagedfor your natural expectation is to see a peer
venerablebut I must say there was not one that I would have picked out
to be a peer for any particular reason in the street And it seemed
to me that since they are constitutional as it were there ought to
be some way of knowing them I reasoned again however that perhaps
my lack of discrimination was due to my not being accustomed to seeing
peersthat possibly the delicate distinctions and values that make up a
peer would be perfectly evident to a person born so to speak under the
shadow of the aristocracy And in the meantime the proceedings began
by everybody standing up I dont know whether I actually expected a
procession and a band but when I discovered that we were all standing
while four or five gentlemen in red gowns walked to the other end of
the room and took chairs my emotions were those of blank surprise
Presently I felt Lady Torquilin give an emphatic tug to my skirt Sit
down child she said Everybody else has Do you want to make a
speechand I sat down quickly Then I observed that a gentleman in
black also in fancy dress was reading something indistinctly to the
four or five redgowned gentlemen who looked very solemn and stately
but said nothing It was so difficult for a stranger to understand that
I did not quite catch what was said to another gentleman in black with
buckled shoes but it must have been to the purport of Go and fetch
it for he suddenly began to walk out backwards stopping at every few
steps to bow with great deference to them of the red gowns which must
have been very trying for nobody returned the bows and he never could
tell who might have come in behind him I suppose he has gone out for a
minute to get something I said to Lady Torquilin and then she told me
what of course I ought to have known if I had refreshed myself with
a little English history before startingthat he was the Usher of
the Black Rod and had been sent to bring the members of the other
Parliament And presently there was a great sound of footsteps in the
corridors outside and your House of Commons came hurrying to the bar
I believe it is called of your House of Lords It was wonderfully
interesting to look at to a stranger that crowd of members of your
Lower House as it came without ceremony to the slender brass rod and
stopped there because it could come no fartherpressing against it
laying hands upon it craning over it and yet held back by the visible
and invisible force of it Compared with the wellfed and wellgroomed
old gentlemen who sat comfortably inside these outsiders looked lean
and unkempt but there were so many of them and they seemed so much
more in earnest than the old gentlemen on the benches that the power
of the brass rod seemed to me extraordinary I should not have been an
American if I had not wondered at it and whether the peers in mufti
would not some day be obliged to make a habit of dressing up in their
mantles and insignia on these occasions to impress the Commoners
properly with a sense of difference and a reason for their staying
outside

Then as soon as they were all ready to pay attention the
ViceChancellor read the Queens letter in which Her Majesty so far as
I could understand regretted her inability to be present told them
all a good deal about what she had been doing since she wrote last
and closed by sending her kind regards and best wishesa very pleasant
letter I thought and wellwritten Then we all stood up again while
the gentlemen in red the Lord Chancellor and the others walked out
after which everybody dispersed and I found myself shaking hands with
Lord Mafferton in a pudgy hearty way as he and Lady Torquilin and I
departed together

Original So this is our little Yankee said Lord Mafferton with his fat round chin stretched out sideways and his hands behind his back Now I am quite fivefeet eight and I do not like being called names but I found a difficulty in telling Lord Mafferton that I was not their little Yankee so I smiled and said nothing Well well Come over the duckpondisnt that what you call the Atlantic Oceanto see how fast old England is going to pieces eh

Oh said Lady Torquilin I think Miss Wick is delighted with England
Lord Mafferton

Yes I said I am Delighted with it Why should anybody think it is
going to pieces

Oh its a popular fancy in some quarters said Lord

Mafferton Being a lord I dont suppose he winked at Lady Torquilin
but he did something very like it

I should call it a popular fallacy I declared at which Lord
Mafferton laughed and said It was all very well it was all very
well exactly like any old grandpapa Miss Wick would like a look over
the place I suppose he said to Lady Torquilin You think it would
be safe eh No explosives concealed about hershe doesnt think of
blowing us up And this very jocular old peer led the way through a
labyrinth of chambers and corridors of which I cant possibly remember
the locality or the purpose because he went so fast

No doubt youve heard of Cromwell he said beside one door I should
have liked to know why he asked me if there was no doubt of it but I
suppose a lord is not necessarily a logician This is the room in which
he signed the deathwarrant of Charles the First

Dear me I said The one that hes holding a copy of on his lap at
Madame Tussauds

I dare say I dare say said Lord Maflerton But not so fast my
dear young lady not so fast You mustnt go in you know Thats not
allowable and he whisked us away to the Library Of course Miss Wick
understands he said to Lady Torquilin that every word spoken here
above a whisper means three days in a dungeon on bread and water By
this time my ideas of peers had become so confused that I was entirely
engaged in trying to straighten them out and had very little to say of
any sort but Lord Mafferton chatted continually as we walked through
the splendid rooms only interrupting himself now and then to remind me
of the dungeon and the penalty of talking It was very difficult getting
a first impression of the English House of Parliament and an English
peer at the same timethey continually interrupted each other It was
in the Royal Banqueting Hall for instance where I was doing my best
to meditate upon scenes of the past that Lord Mafferton stated to Lady
Torquilin his objection to the inside of an omnibus and this in itself
was distracting It would never occur to anybody in America to think of
a peer and an omnibus together The vestibule of the House of Commons
was full of gentlemen walking about and talking but there was a great
deliberateness about the way it was doneno excitement and every man
in his silentlyexpressive silk hat They all seemed interested in each
other in an observing way too and whether to bow or not to bow and
when Lord Mafferton recognised any of them he was usually recognised
back with great cordiality You dont see so much of that when Congress
opens The members in the lobby are usually a great deal too much
wrapped up in business to take much notice of each other I observed
too that the British Government does not provide cuspidores for its
legislators which struck me as reflecting very favourably upon the
legislative sense of propriety here especially as there seemed to be no
obvious demand for such a thing

Bless you my dear young lady you mustnt go in there exclaimed Lord
Mafferton at the door of the House as I stepped in to take a perfectly
inoffensive look at it Out with you quick or theyll have you off to
the Tower before you can say George Washington

But why I asked quite breathless with my sudden exit

Young people should never ask why said Lord Mafferton
seriocomically Thank your American stars that Salisbury or any of
those fellows were not about

This peer evidently thought I was very very youngabout twelve but I
have noticed since that not only peers but all agreeable old gentlemen
in England have a habit of dating you back in this way It is a kindly
wellmeant attitude but it leaves you without very much to say

I thought feminine privileges in your House of Commons very limited
indeed then but considerably more so when I attended a sitting with
Lady Torquilin a week later and disarranged my features for life trying
to look through the diamonds of the iron grating with which Parliament
tries to screen itself from the criticism of its lady relations

Lord Mafferton came up that day with us and explained that the grating
was to prevent the ladies from throwing themselves at the heads of the
unmarried membersa singular precaution The only other reason I could
hear why it should not be taken down was that nobody had done it since
it was put upa remarkably British reason and calculated as most
things seem to be in this country to last

And I saw your Prince that afternoon He came into the Peers Gallery
in a light overcoat and sat down with two or three friends to watch his
people governing their country below He seemed thoroughly interested
and at times when Mr OBrien or Mr OConnor said something that
looked toward the dismemberment of his empire amused And it was an
instructive sight to see your future king pleased and edified and
unencumbered by any disagreeable responsibilities looking on





XII

ITOLD Lady Torquilin that the expression struck me as profane

How ridiculous you are child Its a good old English word Nobody
will understand you if you talk about your rubbers in this country
Goloshes certainly Goloshes goloshes Now go directly
and put them on and dont be impertinent about the English language in
England whatever you may be out of it

I went away murmuring Goloshes goloshes What a perfectly
awfulliterally unutterable word No I love Lady Torquilin and I like
her England but Ill never never never say goloshes Id almost
rather swear And as I slipped on the light thin flexible articles
manufactured I believe in Rochester NY and privately compared them
with the remarkable objects worn by the British nation for the purpose
of keeping its feet dry the difference in the descriptive terms gave me
a certain satisfaction

Lady Torquilin and I were going shopping I had been longing to shop in
London ever since I arrived but as Lady Torquilin remarked my trunks
seemed to make it almost unreasonable So up to this time I had been
obliged to content myself with looking at the things in the windows
until Lady Torquilin said she really couldnt spend so much time in
front of shopwindowswe had better go inside Besides she argued of
course there was this to be saidif you bought a good thing there
it wasalways a good thing I And it isnt as if you were obliged to
pinch my dear I would be the last one to counsel extravagance said
Lady Torquilin Therefore well go to the cheapest place firstand
we got an omnibus It seemed full of people who were all going to the
cheapest place and had already come some of them a long way to go
to it judging by their fares They were not poor people nor
respectablydarned people nor shabbygenteel people Some of them
looked like people with incomes that would have enabled them to avoid
the cheapest place and some gave you the idea that if it were not
for the cheapest place they would not look so well But they had
an invariable expression of content with the cheapest place or
appreciation of it that made me quite certain they would all get out
when we stopped there and they did

We went in with a throng that divided and hurried hither and thither
through long departments upstairs and down past counters heaped with
cheapnesses and under billowing clouds and streaming banners of various
colours marked s d and d in very black letters on a very white
ground The whole place spoke of its cheapness invited you to approach
and have your every want supplied at the lowest possible scale of
profitfor cash Even the clerksas we say in America incorrectly
I believethe people behind the counter suggested the sweet
reasonableness of the tariff not that I mean anything invidious but
they seemed to be drawn from an unpretending inexpensive class of
humanity The tickets claimed your attention everywhere and held it
the prices on them were so remarkably low and it was to me at first
a matter of regret that they were all attached to articles I could not
want under any circumstances For the moment I went in I succumbed to
the cheapest place I desired to avail myself of it to any extentto
get the benefit of those fascinating figures personally and immediately
I followed Lady Torquilin with eagerness exclaiming but nothing would
induce her to stop anywhere she went straight for the trifles she
wanted and I perforce after her There are some things my dear she
said when we reached the right counter that one must come here for
but beyond those few odds and endswell I leave you to judge for
yourself

This was calculated to dash a persons enthusiasm and mine was dashed
at once There is nothing in shopping like a friends firm and
outspoken opinion to change your views I began to think unfavourably
of the cheapest place immediately and during the twentyfive minutes
of valuable time which Lady Torquilin spent in addition to some small
silver upon a box of pink paper trimmings for puddingdishes I had
arrived at a state of objection to the cheapest place which intensified
as we climbed more stairs shared more air with the British Public
of the cheapest place and were jostled at more counters For Lady
Torquilin said now that we are here though I loathe coming except
that its something you ought to do we really might as well see what
there isand she found that there were quite a number of little
things at about a shilling and a hapenny that she absolutely needed
and would have to pay just double for my dear anywhere else By that
time my objection became active and embraced the cheapest place and
everything connected with it quite unreasonably For there was no doubt
about the genuineness of the values offered all over its counters or
about the fact that the clerks were doing the best they could to
sell seven separate shillingsworth at the same moment to different
individuals or of the respectability of the seven people who were
spending the seven shillings It would have been a relief indeed to
have detected something fraudulent among the bargains or some very
great adventuress among the customers It was the deadly monotony of
goodishness and cheapishness in everything and everybody that oppressed
you There were no heights of excellence and no contrasting depthsall
one level of quality wherever you lookedso that the things they sold
at the cheapest placesold with mechanical respect and as fast as
they could tie them upseemed to lack all individuality and to have
no reason for being except to become parcels There was none of the
exultation of bargaingetting the bargains were on a regular system of
fixed lawsthe poetic delight of an unexpected reduction was wholly
absent The cheapest place resolved itself into a vast wellorganised
Opportunity and inside you saw the British Public and the Opportunity
together

Ere is your chainge madam said the holloweyed young woman who had
been waiting upon Lady Torquilin in the matter of a letterweight and a
Japanese umbrella Thank you said Lady Torquilin Im afraid you
get very tired dont you before the day is over my friend asked the
young woman with as sweet a smile as she could have given anybody The
young woman smiled back again and said Very madame but that was
all for three other people wanted her I put this in because it is
one of the little things she often says that show the niceness of Lady
Torquilin

Now what do you think of the cheapest place asked Lady Torquilin as
we walked together in the Edgware Road I told her as I have told you
Hmph said she Its not a shop I like myself but thats what I
call being too picksome You get what you want and if you dont want it
you leave it and why should you care Now by way of variety well go
to the dearest place and the omnibus we got into rattled off in the
direction of Bond Street It struck me then and often since how oddly
different London is from an American city to go shopping in At home the
large important stores are pretty much together in the business part
of the city and anybody can tell from the mere buildings what to expect
in the way of style and price In London you cant tell at all and the
wellknown shops are scattered over square miles of streets by twos and
threes in little individual towns each with its own congregation
of smaller shops and its own butchers and bakers and newsstands and
postoffice and squares and places and blind alleys and strolling
cats and hand organs and to get from one to another of the little towns
it is necessary to make a journey in an omnibus Of course I know there
are a few places preeminent in reputation and form and priceabove
all in pricewhich gather in a few wellknown streets but life in
all these little centres which make up London would be quite complete
without them They seem to exist for the benefit of that extravagant
element here that has nothing to do with the small respectable houses
and the little domestic squares but hovers over the city during the
time of year when the sun shines and the fogs are not living during
that time in notable localities under the special inspection of the
Morning Post The people who really live in Londonthe people of
the little centrescan quite well ignore these places they have their
special shop in Uxbridge Road or St Pauls Churchyard and if they
tire of their own particular local cut they can make morning trips
from Uxbridge Road to the High Street Kensington or from either to
Westboume Grove To Americans this is very novel and amusing and we get
a great deal of extra pleasure out of shopping in London in sampling so
to speak the different submunicipalities

While I was thinking these things Lady Torquilin poked me with her
parasol from the other end of the omnibus Tell him to stop she said
and I did at least the gentleman in the corner made the request for
me That gentleman in the corner is a feature of your omnibus system I
think His arm or his stick or his umbrella is always at the service
of any lady who wants the bell rung It seems to be a duty that goes
with the corner seat cheerfully accepted by every man that sits there

We had arrived in Bond Street at the dearest place From what Lady
Torquilin told me I gathered that Bond Street was a regular haunt for
dearest places but it would be impossible for any stranger to suppose
so from walking through itit is so narrow and crooked and irregular
and the shops are so comparatively insignificant after the grand sweep
of Regent Street and the wide variety of the circuses For one I should
have thought circuses would be the best possible places for business
in London not only because the address is so easily remembered but
because once you get into them they are so extremely difficult to get
out of However a stranger never can tell

Inside the dearest place was a stronger contrast to the cheapest
place than I could describe by any antithesis There was an exclusive
emptiness about it that seemed to suggest a certain temerity in coming
in and explained considered commercially why the rare visitors
should have such an expensive time of it One or two tailormade ladies
discussed something in low tones with an assistant and beside these
there was nobody but a couple of seriousminded shopwalkers some
very elegant young ladiesinwaiting and the dummies that called
your attention to the fashions they were exhibiting The dummies were
headless but probably by the variety of their clothes they struck you
as being really the only personalities in the shop We looked at some
of them before advancing far into the august precincts of the dearest
place and Lady Torquilin had a sweeping opinion of them Hideous I
call them she said but she said it in rather a hushed tone quite
different from the one she would have used in the cheapest place and I
am sure the shopwalker did not overhear Bulgarian atrocities How in
the world people imagine such things And as to setting to work to make
them

I cant say I agreed with Lady Torquilin for there was a distinct idea
in all the dresses and a person always respects an idea whether it is
pretty or not but neither can I profess an admiration for the fashions
of the dearest place They were rather hard and unsympathetic they
seemed to sacrifice everything to be in some degree striking their
motto seemed to be Let us achieve a differencepresumably from the
fashions of places that were only dear in the comparative degree While
we were looking at them one of the pale young women strolled languidly
up and remarked with an absent expression that one of them was
considered a smart little gown moddam Smart enough I daresay
said Lady Torquilin with a slightly invidious emphasis on the
adjective whereat the young woman said nothing but looked volumes of
repressed astonishment at the ignorance implied Lady Torquilin went on
to describe the kind of dress I thought of buying

Original Certainly moddam Will you take a seat moddam Something quite simple I think you said moddam and in muslin Ill be with you in one moment moddam And the young woman crawled away with the negligence that became the dearest place After an appreciable time she returned with her arms full of what they used to call so very correctly furbelows in spotted and flowered muslins

Dearie me said Lady Torquilin Thats precisely what I wore when I
was a girl

Yes moddam said the young woman condescending to the ghost of
a smile The old styles are all comin in againat which burst of
responsiveness she suddenly brought herself up sharply and assumed a
manner which forbade you to presume upon it

I picked up one of the garlanded muslins and asked the price of it It
had three frills round the bottom and various irrelevant ribbonbows

Certainly moddam One moment moddam as she looked at the ticket
attached

This one is seventeen guineas moddam Silk foundation A Paris model
moddam but I dare say we could copy it for you for less

Lady Torquilin and I made a simultaneous movement and looked at each
other in the expressive way that all ladies understand who go shopping
with each other

Thanks I said It is much too expensive for me

We have nothing of this style under fifteen guineas moddam replied
the young woman with a climax of weary frigidity Then shall we go

I asked Lady Torquilinand we went

What a price said Lady Torquilin as we left the dearest place behind
us

I said I thought it was an insulteightyfive dollars for a readymade
sprigged muslin dressto the intelligence of the people who were
expected to buy it That for my part I should feel a distinct loss of
selfrespect in buying anything at the dearest place What would I be
paying for

For being able to say that it came from the dearest place said Lady
Torquilin But I thought you Americans didnt mind what anything cost

That misconception of Lady Torquilins is a popular one and I was
at some pains to rectify it We dont I said if we recognise the
fairness of it but nobody resents being imposed upon more than an
American Lady Torquilin We have our idiots like other nations and
I daresay a good many of them come to London every year and deal
exclusively at the dearest place but as a nation though we dont
scrimp we do like the feeling that we are paying for value received

Well said Lady Torquilin I believe that is the case I know
Americans talk a great deal about the price of thingsmore I consider
than is entertaining sometimes I said I knew they didit was a
national faultand what did Lady Torquilin think the dress I had on
cost just to compare it with that muslin and Chicago was by no means
a cheap place for anything Lady Torquilin said she hadnt an ideaour
dollars were so difficult to reckon in but what did I think hers came
toand not a scrap of silk lining about it And so the time slipped
away until we arrived in the neighbourhood of Cavendish Square at
what Lady Torquilin called the happy medium where the windows were
tempting and the shopwalker smiled and the ladyinwaiting was a
person of great dignity in high black sleeves with a delightful
French accent when she talked which she very seldom forgot and only
contradicted when she said Ow and elliotrope and where things
cost just about what they did in America

Original I have gone very patiently ever since to the happy medium partly to acquire the beautiful composure of the ladyinwaiting partly to enjoy the respect which all Americans like so much in a wellconducted English shop and partly because at the happy medium they understand how to turn shopping into the pleasant artistic pastime it ought to be which everybody in America is in far too much of a hurry to make a fortune and retire to do for his customers I am on the most agreeable footing with the lady in the sleeves now and I have observed that as our acquaintance progresses her command of English consonantal sounds remarkably increases But I have never been able to reconcile myself even theoretically either to the cheapest place in the Edgware Road or the dearest place in Bond Street





XIII



Original AS a nation I cant bear emindividually I like em fairly well read out Lady Torquilin from a letter at breakfast Bless me my friend went on shes talking about Americans and shes coming to see your specimenmeaning you childthis very afternoon

So she did She came to see me that very afternoonthe lady who
couldnt bear us as a nation but individually liked us fairly well Her
name was Corke and she belonged Lady Torquilin said to the Corkes I
heard all about her before she came She was a lady of moderate
income unmarried about ten years older than I was She knew all about
everything

You never saw such a reader my dear I wont say it happens often
for that it does not but Peter Corke has made me feel like a perfect
ignoramus

Peter Corke I said with some surprise

Too ridiculous I call it Her proper name is Catharine Clarissa
but she hates her proper namesensible girl as she is in every other
wayprefers Peter And if she happens to take a fancy to you she will
tell you all manner of interesting things For old holes and corners I
always say go to Peter Corke

Im glad I said that she likes us individually fairly wellits
the only way in which I would have any chance But she wont like my
accent

If she doesnt Lady Torquilin said I promise you shell tell you
And you wont mind a bit

When Miss Corke arrived I forgot entirely about the doubtfulness of her
liking meI was too much absorbed in liking her She was rather a small
person with a great deal of dignity in her shoulders and a great deal
of humour in her facethe most charming face I have seen in England
and I cant even make an exception in favour of the Princess of Wales
I may tell you that she had delightful twinkling brown eyes and hair a
shade darker and the colour and health and energy that only an English
woman possesses at thirty without being in the least afraid that
you could pick her out in the street or anywhereshe would not like
thatand being put in print so that people would know her at all
its a thing I wouldnt do on any account knowing her feelings It is
only because I am so well convinced that I cant tell you what she was
like that I try which you may consider a feminine reason if you want
to Miss Peter Corkes personality made you think at once of Santa Claus
and a profound philosophercould you have a more difficult combination
to describe than that While you listened to a valuable piece of advice
from her lips you might be quite certain that she had an orange for you
in the hand behind her back and however you might behave you would get
the orange Part of her charm was the atmosphere of gay beneficence she
carried about with her that made you want to edge your chair closer to
wherever she was sitting and part of it was the remarkable interest she
had in everything that concerned youa sort of interest that made
you feel as if such information as you could give about yourself was
a direct and valuable contribution to the sum of her knowledge of
humanity and part of it was the salutary sincerity of everything she
had to say in comment though I ought not to forget her smile which
was a great deal of it I am sure I dont know why I speak of Miss Peter
Corke in the past tense however She is not deador even married I
cannot imagine a greater misfortune to her large circle of friends in
London

Two lumps please begged Miss Corke of me in the midst of a
succession of inquiries about Lady Torquilins cough whether it could
possibly be gout or if she had been indulging in salmon and
cucumber lately in which case it served her perfectly right What a
disappointment you are Why dont you ask me if I like it with all the
trimmings

The trimmings I repeated

Certainly the sugar and milk Fancy being obliged to explain
Americanisms to an American said Miss Corke to Lady Torquilin

Is trimmings an Americanism I asked I never heard it before But I
dare say it is an expression peculiar to Boston perhaps

You had better not have any doubt said Miss Corke with mock
ferocity of anything you hear in England

Ive heard fixings often at home I declared but never trimmings

Oh remarked Miss Corke genially then fixings is the correct
expression

I dont know I said about its being the correct expression Our
washerwoman uses it a good deal

Oh said Miss Corke with an indescribable inflection of amusement
and then she looked at me over the top of her teacup as much as to say
you had better not go too far

Are your father and mother living she asked and just then I noticed
that it was twenty minutes past four by the clock I answered Miss Corke
in the affirmative and naturally I was glad to be able to but I have
often wondered since why that invariable interest in the existence or
nonexistence of a persons parents should prevail in England as it
does I have seldom been approached by any one in a spirit of kindly
curiosity with a different formula Any brothers and sisters Miss
Corke went on When did you come Where did you go first How long do
you mean to stay What have you seen Did you expect us to be as we are
or do we exceed your expectations Have you ever travelled alone before
Are you quite sure you like the feeling of being absolutely independent
Dont you love our nice old manners and customs and wont you wish when
you get back that you could put your President on a golden throne with
an ermine robe and a sceptre in his right hand

Miss Corke gave me space between these questions for brief answers but
by the time I looked at the clock again and saw that it was twentyfive
minutes past four to the best of my recollection she had asked me
twelve I liked it immenselyit made conversation so easy but I
could not help thinking in connection with it of the capacity
for interrogation which I had always heard credited exclusively to
Americans

Peter said Lady Torquilin at last a little tired of it ask
something about me I havent seen you for weeks

Dear lady said Peter of course I will But this is something new
you see so one takes an ephemeralvery ephemeralinterest in it

Lady Torquilin laughed I Well said she theres nothing more
wonderful than the way it gets about alone

Then I laughed too I did not find anything in the least objectionable
in being called an it by Miss Corke

So youve been in England a whole month said she And what do you
think you have observed about us Basing your opinion said Miss Corke
with seriocomicality upon the fact that we are for your admiration
and not for your criticism how do you like us

I couldnt help it Individually I said I like you fairly wellas
a nation I cant

Oh cried Miss Corke in a little funny squeal rushing at Lady
Torquilin youve gone and told heryou wicked womanand she shook
Lady Torquilin a thing I didnt see how she dared to do I cant
bear it and I wont Private correspondenceI wonder youre not
ashamedand Miss Corke sank into a chair and covered her face with
her hands and her handkerchief and squealed again more comically than
before

By the time I had been acquainted with Miss Corke a fortnight I had
learned to look for that squeal and to love it She probably will not
know until she reads this chapter how painfully I have tried to copy it
and how vainly doubtless owing to the American nature of my larynx But
Miss Corke had a way of railing at you that made you feel rather pleased
that you had misbehaved I could see that it had that effect upon Lady
Torquilin though all she did was to smile broadly and say to Miss
Peter Hoitytoity Have another cup of tea In the course of further
conversation Miss Corke said that she saw my mind must be improved
immediately if she had to do it herself and where would I like to
begin I said almost anywhere I didnt think it much mattered and Miss
Corke said Well that was candid on my part and augured favourably
and was I architectururally inclined I said I thought I was some and
out came Miss Peter Corkes little shriek again Tell her she
said prodding Lady Torquilin that we say rather over here in that
connection I dont know her well enough And I was obliged to beg Lady
Torquilin to tell her that we said some over there in that connection
though not in books or university lectures or seriousminded
magazines

Oh come said Miss Corke do you mean to say youve got any
seriousminded magazines

Ill come anywhere you like I responded Have you got any
lightminded ones

Whereat Miss Corke turned again to Lady Torquilin and confided to her
that I was a flippant young woman to live in the same house with and
Lady Torquilin assured her that there wasnt really any harm in meit
was only my way

Hm remarked Miss Peter perking up her chin in a manner that made
me long to be on kissing terms with herthe American way As I write
that it looks disagreeable as Peter Corke said it it was the very
nectar and ambrosia of prejudiced and favourable criticism And I soon
found out that whatever she might say her words never conveyed anything
but herselfnever had any significance I mean that your knowledge of
her delightful nature did not endorse

I suppose wed better begin with the churches dont you think said
Miss Corke to Lady Torquilin Poor dear I dare say shes never seen a
proper church

Oh yes I said you have never been in Chicago Miss Corke or you
wouldnt talk like that We have several of the finest in America in our
city and we ourselves attend a very large one erected last year the
Congregationalthough momma has taken up Theosophy considerably
lately Its built in amphitheatre style with all the latest
improvementselectric light and heated with hot water all through
It will seat five thousand people on springedged cushions and has a
lovely kitchen attached for socials Built in the amphitheatre style
repeated Miss Corke To seat five thousand people on springedged
cushionswith a kitchen attached And now will you tell me immediately
what a social is

There are different kinds you know I replied Icecream socials
and oyster socials and ordinary teameetings but they nearly always
have something to eat in thema dry social with only a collection
never amounts to much And theyre generally held in the basement of the
church and the young ladies of the congregation wait

Miss Corke looked at me amused and aghast You see I was quite
right she said to Lady Torquilin She never has But I think this
really ought to be reported to the Foreign Missions Society Ill take
you to the Abbey tomorrow she went on You like deaders
dont you The time between might be profitably spent in fasting and
meditation Goodbye dear loveto Lady Torquilin No you will not
come down either of you Remember young lady threethirty sharp at
the entrance everybody uses opposite Dizzys statuethe same which you
are never on any account to call Dizzy but always Lord Disraeli with
the respect that becomes a foreigner Goodbye

Original HAT do you mean asked Miss Corke indicating the Parliament House clock with a reproachful parasol as I joined her a week from the following afternoon outside the south cloister of the Abbey We had seen a good deal of her in the meantime but the Abbey visit had been postponed Her tone was portentous and I looked at the clock which said ten minutes to four I didnt quite understand for I thought I was in pretty good time Didnt you say I was to come about now I inquired Miss Corke made an inarticulate exclamation of wrath

Halfpast three may be about now in America she said but it isnt
here as you may see by the clock Fancy my having made an appointment
with a young person who had an idea of keeping it about the time I had
condescended to fixand Miss Corke put down her parasol as we entered
the cloisters and attempted to wither me with a glance If the glance
had not had the very jolliest smile of goodfellowship inside it I dont
know what I should have done but as it was I didnt wither though I
regretted to hear that I had missed the Jerusalem Chamber by being late
where King Henry diedbecause he always knew he should expire in a
place of that name and so fulfilled prophecy poor dear by coming to
kneel on the cold stone at St Edwards shrine where he would always
say his prayers and nowhere else immediately after a number of
extraordinary Christmas dinnersand Miss Corke was not in the least
sorry for me though it was a thing I ought to see and we positively
must come another day to see it

We walked up past the little green square that you see in wide spaces
through the side pillars where the very oldest old monks lie nameless
and forgotten whose lives gathered about the foundations of the
Abbeythe grey foundations in the grey pastand sank silently into
its history just as their bodily selves have disappeared long ago in the
mosses and grasses that cover them No Miss Mamie Wick of Chicago
I will not hurry said Miss Corke and neither shall you It is a
sacrilege that I will allow no young person in my company to committo
go through these precincts as if there were anything in the world as
well worth looking at outside of them

I said I didnt want to hurry in the very least

Are you sure you dontinside of you she demanded Certain you have
no lurking private ambition to do the Abbey in two hours and get it
over Oh I know you Ive brought lots of you here before

I know I said I as a nation we do like to get a good deal for our
time

Its promising when you acknowledge itMiss Corke laughed All the
old abbots used to be buried here up to the time of Henry III thats
probably one of emand Miss Corkes parasol indicated a long thick
bluish stone thing lying on its back with a round lump at one end and
an imitation of features cut on the lump It lay there very solidly
along the wall and I tried in vain to get a point of view from which it
was expressive of anything whatever One of the early abbots said I
because it seemed necessary to say something

Probably said Miss Corke

Which particular abbot should you say I asked deferentially for I
felt that I was in the presence of something very early English indeed
and that it became me to be impressed whether I was or not

Oh I dont know Miss Peter Corke replied Postard perhaps or
Crispin or maybe Vitalis nobody knows

I suppose it would have been easier to tell a while ago I said
There is something so worn about his face I should think even the
other early abbots would find a difficulty in recognising him now
Nothing Druidical I suppose

Certainly not If you are going to be disrespectful said Miss Corke
I shall take you home at once Whereat I protested that I did not
dream disrespectthat he looked to me quite as much like a Druid as
anything else I even ventured to say that if she had not told me he
was an early abbot I might have taken him for something purely and
entirely geological The whole of this discussion took place at what
stood for the early abbots feet and occupied some little time so
that finally Miss Corke was obliged to tell me that if there was one
thing she couldnt bear it was dawdling and would I be pleased to look
at the monumental tablet to Mr Thomas Thynne of which she would relate
to me the history So we paused in front of it while Miss Corke told
me how the gentleman in the basrelief chariot was Mr Thomas Thynne
and the gentleman on horseback shooting at him with a blunderbuss was
Knigsmark accompanied by his brother and Knigsmark was in the act of
killing Mr Thomas Thynne with the horses getting unmanageable and the
two powdered footmen behind in a state of great agitation because both
Mr Thomas Thynne and Knigsmark were attached to the same ladya young
widow lady with a great deal of moneyand she liked Mr Thomas Thynne
best which was more than Mr Knigsmark could bear So Mr Knigsmark
first swore properly that he would do it and then did itall in Pall
Mall when Mr Thomas was in the very act of driving home from paying a
visit to the widow It was a most affecting story as Peter Corke told
it especially in the presence of the memorial with a white marble Cupid
pointing to it erected by Mr Thynnes bereaved relatives and I
was glad to hear that the widow had nothing to do with Mr Knigsmark
afterwards in spite of the simplicity and skill of his tactics
with regard to his rival I thought the history of the event quite
interesting enough in itself but Miss Corke insisted that the point
about it really worthy of attention was the fact that the younger Mr
Knigsmark was the gentleman who afterwards went back to Hanover and
there flirted so disgracefully with Sophia Dorothea of Zell that King
George said he wouldnt have it and shut her up in Ahlden Tower
for thirtytwo years Miss Corke explained it all in a delightful
kindergarten way mentioning volumes for my reference if I wanted to
know more about the incident Although this she said is the sort
of thing you ought to have been improving your mind with ever since you
learned to read I dont know what you mean by it coming over here with
a vast unbroken field of ignorance about our celebrities Do you think
time began in  At which I retaliated and said that far from being
an improving incident I wasnt sure that it was altogether respectable
and I didnt know of a single church in Chicago that would admit a
basrelief of it with or without a mourning Cupid In return to which
Miss Corke could find nothing better to say than Lawks

Dont tell me youve read the Spectator she remarked a little
farther on because I know you haventyouve read nothing but W D
Howells and the New York World Oh you have Several essays When
pray At schoolI thought so When you couldnt help it Well I know
youve forgotten Sir Roger de Coverley in the Abbey stopping
Addison here to tell him that man thrashed his grandfather His own
grandfather you know not Addisons And we contemplated the studious
effigy of Dr Busby until I told Miss Corke that I wanted to be taken to
the Poets Corner

Of course you do said she there are rows of Americans there now
sitting looking mournful and thinking up quotations If I wanted to find
an American in London I should take up my position in the Poets
Corner until he arrived You neednt apologiseits nothing to your
discredit remarked Miss Corke as we turned in among your wonderful
crumbling old names past the bust of George Grote historian of Greece
Of course you have heard of his ladywife she said nodding at Mr
Grote I ventured the statement that she was a very remarkable person

Well she was returned Miss Corke though thats a shot in the dark
and you might as well confess it One of the most remarkable women of
her time All the biographers of the day wrote about heras you ought
to know intimately I have the honour of the acquaintance of a niece
of hers who told me the other day that she wasnt particularly fond of
her Great independence of character

Where is Chaucer I asked wishing to begin at the beginning

Just like every one of you that Ive ever brought here Miss Corke
exclaimed leading the way to the curious old rectangular grey tomb in
the wall The very bestthe very oldestimmediately Such impatience
I never saw There nowmake out that early English lettering if you
can and be properly sorry that youve renounced your claim to be proud
of it

I cant make it out so Ill think about being sorry later I said
It is certainly very remarkable he might almost have written it
himself Now where is Shakespeare

Oh certainly exclaimed Miss Corke This way And after that youll
declare youve seen them all But you might just take time to understand
that youre walking over O rare Ben Jonson who is standing up in his
old bones down there as straight as you or I Insistedas you probably
are not awareon being buried that way so as to be ready when Gabriel
blows his trumpet in the morning I wont say that he hasnt got his
coat and hat on Yes thats SamuelIm glad you didnt say Ben was the
lexicographer Miltoncertainlyits kind of you to notice him
Blind you remember The author of several works of some reputationin
England

I knew he was blind I said and used to dictate to his daughters We
have a picture of it at home I made this remark very innocently and
Miss Corke looked at me with a comical smile Bless it and save it
she said and then with an attempt at a reproach What a humbug it
is

We looked at Shakespeare supreme among them predicting solemn
dissolution out of The Tempest and turned from him to Gay whose
final reckless word I read with as much astonishment as if I had never
heard of it before



Lifes a jest and all things show it

I thought so once and now I know it



has no significance at all read in an American schoolbook two thousand
miles and a hundred and fifty years from the writer of it compared
with the grim shock it gives you when you see it actually cut deep in
the stone to be a memorial always of a dead man somewhere not far away

Original That you should have heard of Nicholas Rowe said Miss Corke is altogether too much to expect Dear me it would be considerably easier to improve your mind if it had ever been tried before But he was poetlaureate for George the Firstyou understand the term

I think so I said They contract to supply the Royal Family with
poetry by the year at a salary We have nothing of the kind in
America You see our Presidents differ so They might not all like
poetry And in that case it would be wasted for there isnt a magazine
in the country that would take it secondhand

Besides having no poets who could do it properly poor things said
Miss Corketo which I acceded without difficulty

Well Mr Rowe was a poetlaureate though that has nothing whatever
to do with it But he had a great friend in Mr PopePope you know
himby reputationand when he and his daughter died Mr Pope and Mrs
Rowe felt so bad about it that he wrote those mournful lines and she
hadem put up

Now listen



To those so mourned in death so lovd in life

The childless parent and the widowed wife



meaning the same lady it was only a neat way they had of doubling up a
sentiment in those days



With tears inscribes this monumental stone

That holds their ashes and expects her own



and everybody including Mr Pope thought it perfectly sweet at the
time Then what does this degenerate widow do after giving Mr Pope
every reason to believe that she would fulfil his poetry

She marries again I said

Quite right she marries again But you neednt try to impose upon
me miss To come to that conclusion you didnt require any previous
information whatever She marries again and you cant think how it
vexed Mr Pope

I know I said he declared that was the last of his lending the
use of his genius to widowsfor I had to assume some knowledge of the
subject

Miss Corke looked at me You idjit she said He did nothing of the
sort

Michael Drayton I read amongst other names which surprised me by
their unfamiliarity for in America whatever Peter Corke may say if we
have a strong point it is nameswho was Michael Drayton and why was
he entitled to a bust

He wrote the Polyolbion said Miss Corke as if that were all there
was to say about it

Do you know I saidI am ashamed to confess it but even of so
wellknown and interesting a work of genius as the Polyolbion I have
committed very few pages to memory

Oh returned Miss Peter youre getting unbearable Theres a lovely
epitaph for you of Edmund Spensers whose divine spirrit needs noe
othir witnesse than the workes which he left behind him You will
kindly make no ribald remarks about the spelling as I perceive you are
thinking of doing Try and remember that we taught you to spell over
there And when Edmund Spenser was buried dear damsel there came a
company of poets to the funeralShakespeare doubtless among themand
cast into his grave all manner of elegies

Of their own composition I inquired

Stupidcertainly And the pens that wrote them

I said I thought it a most beautiful and poetic thing to have done if
they kept no copies of the poems and asked Miss Corke if she believed
anything of the kind would be possible now

Bless you she replied In the first place there arent the poets
in the second place there isnt the heroworship in the third place
the conditions of the poetrymarket are different nowadaysits more
expensive than it used to be the poets would prefer to send wreaths
from the floristsyou can get quite a nice one for twelveandsix
and Peter Corke made a little grimace expressive of disgust with the
times We used to have all poets and no public now we have all public
and no poets she declared now that he is goneand Tennyson cant
live for ever Miss Corke pointed with her parasol to a name in the
stone close to my right foot I had been looking about me and above me
and everywhere but there As I read it I took my foot away quickly and
went two or three paces off It was so unlookedfor that name so new
to its association with death that I stood aside held by a sudden
sense of intrusion He had always been so high and so far off in the
privacy of his genius so revered in his solitudes so unapproachable
that it took ones breath away for the moment to have walked
unthinkingly over the grave of Robert Browning It seemed like taking an
advantage one would rather not have takeneven to stand aside and read
the plain strong name in the floor and know that he having done with
life had been brought there and left where there could be no longer
about him any wonderings or any surmises Miss Corke told me that she
knew him as one can say one knows such a man and how kindly his
interest was in all that the ordinary people of his acquaintance like
herself were thinking and doing but the little homely stories she
related to me from her personal knowledge of him seemed curiously
without relevance then Nothing mattered except that he who had
epitomised greatness in his art for the century lay there beneath his
name in the place of greatness And then immediately from this grave
of yesterday there came to me light and definition for all the
graves of the day before It stole among the quaint lettering of the
inscriptions and into the dusty corners of the basreliefs and behind
all the sculptured scrolls and laurels and showed me what I had somehow
missed seeing soonerall that shrined honour means in England and just
in that one little corner how great her possessions are Miss Corke said
something about the royal tombs and the coronation chair and the wax
effigies in the chamber above the Islip Chapel and getting on but I
if you dont mind I said I should like to sit down here for a while
with the other Americans and think





XV



Original t is said that there are four hundred people in New York who are exclusive and there are a few more on Beacon Hill in Boston and in Philadelphia But most Americans are opposed to exclusiveness I know that nothing of the sort flourishes in Chicago Generally and individually Americans believe that every man is as good as his neighbour and we take pains to proclaim our belief whenever the subject of class distinction is under discussion Poppas views howeverrepresenting those of the majority in an individual as we hope they soon may do in a senatorare strongly against any theory of exclusiveness whatever And I will say for poppa that his principles are carried out in his practice for to my knowledge neither his retirement from business and purchase of a suburban lakeside residence nor even his nomination for the Senate has made the slightest difference in his treatment of any human being And yet Americans coming over here with all their social theories in their trunks so to speak very carefully packed to be ready at a moments notice very seldom seem to find a use for them in England I was brought up you might say on poppas and momma agreed with him on most points with the one qualification that if you couldnt have nice society it was much better to go without anyScarce company welcome trumpery momma always declared would never be her motto Yet since I have been in England I have hardly had occasion to refer to them at all I listened to an American author about it a while ago before I had any intention of writing my own English experiences and he said the reason Americans liked the exclusiveness over here was because its operation gave them such perfect types to study each of its own little circle while at home we are a great indeterminate shifting mass and a person who wanted to know us as a nation must know us very largely as individuals first I thought that might be a very good reason for an author especially for an author who liked an occasional cup of tea with a duchess but I was not sure that it could be claimed by a person like myself only over on a visit and not for any special purpose of biological research So I went on liking the way you shut some people out and let other people in without inquiring further as to why I didit did not seem profitable especially when I reflected that my point of view was generally from the inside My democratic principles are just the same as ever thougha person neednt always approve what she likes I shall take them back quite unimpaired to a country where they are indispensablewhere you really want them if you are going to be comfortable every day of your life

Nevertheless I know it was the private part of the Private View
that made me so anxious to go to the Academy on the first day of May
this year The pictures would be there the second day and the day
following and days indefinitely after that and for a quarter of a
dollar I could choose my own time and circumstances of going to see
them I might weather permitting have taken my view of the Academy
in the publicity of five or six other people who like me would have
paid a shilling apiece to get in but I found myself preferring the
privacy of the five or six hundred who did not paypreferring it
immensely Besides I had heard all my life of the Private View Every
year there are special cablegrams about it in our newspaperswho were
there and what they woregenerally to the extent of at least a column
and a half Our special correspondents in London glory in it and rival
each other adjectivally in describing it Lady Torquilin had been
talking about it a good deal too She said it was a thing to see
and she meant to try to get me an invitation Lady Torquilin went every
year

But when the thirtieth day of April came Lady Torquilin told me in
the evening after dinner that she hadnt been able to manage it and
showed me the card upon which the President and Members of the
Royal Academy of Arts requested the pleasure of the company of Lady
Torquilin only Not transferable

Its very tiresome of them said Lady Torquilin to put that on It
means that you positively must not give it to anybody Otherwise I would
have handed it over to you child with the greatest pleasureI
dont care a pins point about going and you could have gone with the
PastelleBrowns But there it is

Of course nothing would have induced me to take Lady Torquilins
invitation and deprive her of the pleasure of going but I pinned her
veil at the back and saw her off down the elevator next day at two
with an intensity of regret which cannot come often in the course of an
ordinary lifetime I was describing my feelings in a letter addressed
I think to Mr Winterhazel when about an hour later Lady Torquilin
appeared again flushed with exertion and sank panting into a chair

Get ready child said she Id wear your tailormade those stairs
will kill me but there wasno timeto waste on the lift I can get
you inhurry up your cakes

But am I invited I asked

Certainly you areby a Royal Academician in personso fly

I flew and in twenty minutes Lady Torquilin and I were engaged in our
usual altercation with a cabman on the way to Burlington House When he
had got his cab and animal well into a block in Bond Street and nothing
of any sort could possibly happen without the sanction of a Jovelike
policeman at the crossing Lady Torquilin took the opportunity of
telling me how it was that she was able to come for me You see she
said the very first person I had the good luck to meet when I went
in was Sir Bellamy Bellamyyou remember Sir Bellamy Bellamy at the
Mintherringtons I tell you frankly that I wouldnt have mentioned it
my dear unless he had first though I knew perfectly well that what Sir
Bellamy Bellamy cant do in that Academy simply cant be done for you
know Im the last one to push but he did Where is your young friend
said he Then I took my chance and told him how Id asked that old
screw of a Monkhouse Diddlington for two and only got one and how
I couldnt possibly give it to you because it was printed Not
transferable and how disappointed you were and he was nice about it
My dear Lady Torquilin he said we were children together and you
never came to me I should have been delighted

Well I said Sir Bellamy cant we do anything about it now Its
rather late in the day said he It is late in the day said I Oh
I say said he she must come if she wants toany friend of yours
Lady Torquilinsuch a humbug as the man is Its a bit irregular he
went on and we wont say anything about it but if you like to go and
get her and see that she carries this in with her here Lady
Torquilin produced a fat paleblue catalogue book there wont be
any difficulty I fancy So there you are Miss Wick provided with
Sir Bellamy Bellamys own catalogue to admit youif thats not a
compliment I dont know what is

I dont feel as if I had been properly invited I said Im afraid I
oughtnt to go Lady Torquilin

Rubbish child said she Do you want them to send a deputation for
you And after that what could I say

Hold up your head and look perfectly indifferent advised Lady
Torquilin as our hansom deposited us in the courtyard before the outer
steps Dont grasp that catalogue as if it were a banner carry it
carelessly Now follow me And Lady Torquilin with great dignity a
sense of rectitude and a catalogue to which she was properly entitled
followed by me with vague apprehensions a bad conscience and a
catalogue that didnt belong to me walked into the Private View Nobody
said anything though I fancied one of the two old gentlemen in crimson
and black by the door looked knowingly at the other when I passed as
much as to say About that tailormade there is something fraudulent
I say I fancied though at the time I was certain they did because my
imagination of course may have had something to do with it I know
I was very glad of the shelter of Lady Torquilins unimpeachable
respectability in front There now she said when we were well into
the crowd were both here and its much nicer isnt it dear than
for you to come with strangers even if I could have made up my mind
that it was right for you to be admitted on a ticket plainly marked not
transferablewhich I really dont think dear I should have been able
to do

We moved aimlessly with the throng and were immediately overtaken and
possessed by the spirit that seemed to be abroada spirit of wonder and
criticism and speculation and searching that first embraced our
nearest neighbours went off at random to a curiouslydressed person in
perspective focussed upon a celebrity in a corner and spent itself in
the shifting crowd Lady Torquilin bade me consider whether in all my
life before I had ever seen such remarkable gowns and I was obliged to
confess that I had not Some of them were beautiful and some were not
many were what you so very properly and aptly call smart and a few
were artistic All of them pretty and ugly I might have encountered at
home but there was one species of frock which no American I think
could achieve with impunity It was a protest against conventionalism
very much gathered and usually presented itself in colours
unattainable out of a London fog It almost always went with a rather
discouragedlooking lady having a bad complexion and hair badly done
up and invariably it dragged a little on one side I dont know
exactly why that kind of dress would be an impossible adjunct to the
person of an American woman but I am disposed to believe there is a
climatic reason We have so much sun and oxygen in the United
States that I think they get into our ideas of clothes and a person
upholstered in the way I have mentioned would very likely find herself
specially and disrespectfully described in the newspapers But I do not
wish to be thought impertinent about the development of this particular
English dress ideal It has undoubted points of interest I had a better
opportunity of observing it at the Academy Soire in June when it shed
abroad the suggestion of a Tennysonian idyll left out all night

Lady Torquilin had just pointed out to me two duchesses one large and
round who was certainly a duchess by mistake and the other tall and
beautiful with just such a curved upper lip as a duchess ought to have
and a coronet easily imaginable under her bonnet and we were talking
about them when I saw somebody I knew He was a middleaged gentleman
and I had a very interesting association with his face though I
couldnt for the moment remember his name or where I had met him I told
Lady Torquilin about it with the excited eagerness that a person always
feels at the sight of a familiar face in a foreign land Some friend of
poppas I am certain I said and although I had only had a glimpse
of him and immediately lost him in the crowd we decided to walk on
in that direction in the hope of seeing him again He reappeared at
a distance and again we lost him but we kept on and while Lady
Torquilin stopped to chat with her numerous acquaintances I looked out
carefully for my fathers friend I knew that as soon as he saw me he
would probably come up at once and shake hands and then the name would
come back to me and I yearned to ask a thousand things of Chicago
We came face to face with him unexpectedly and as his eye caught mine
carelessly it dawned upon me that the last time I had seen him it
was not in a long grey overcoat and a silk hatthere was something
incongruous in that Also I remembered an insolent grizzled chin and
great duplicity Oh I said to Lady Torquilin I dont know him at
all Its

Its Mr Bancroft said Lady Torquilin

Who is Mr Bancroft said I Its the Abb Latour

I had enjoyed The Dead Heart so much a fortnight before but I was
glad I did not bow before I recognised that it was a gentleman with
whom I had the honour of possessing only tenandsixpence worth of
acquaintance

I saw the various scandals of the year as well Lady Torquilin mentioned
them just to call my attention to their dresses generally giving her
opinion that there had been altogether too much said about the matter
Lady Torquilin did not know many of the literary people who were
present but she indicated Mr Anstey and Mr William Black whose works
are extremely popular with us and it was a particular pleasure to be
able to describe them when I wrote home next day I wanted to see Mr
Oscar Wilde very especially but somebody told Lady Torquilin he was at
the Grosvenorand small loss I consider said she hes just like
any other man dear child only with more nonsense in his head than most
of them But it was not in the nature of things or people that Lady
Torquilin should like Mr Oscar Wilde Before we went she showed me two
or three ladyjournalists busy taking notes

Theres that nice Miss Jay Penne said Lady Torquilin I know all the
Jay Pennessuch a literary family And Miss Jay Penne always wants to
know what Ive got on I think I must just speak to her dear if you
dont mind waiting one moment and then well go

She asked about you too dear said my friend when she rejoined me
with a little nudge of congratulation

I should perhaps have stated before that there were a number of
artists walking around trying to keep away from their own pictures
but this I gathered of myself for with the exception of Sir Bellamy
Bellamy who had gone away Lady Torquilin did not know any of them I
noticed too that the walls of the rooms we were in were covered with
pictures but they did not seem to have anything to do with the Private
View





XVI



Original ADY POWDERBYS ball was the first I attended in London and therefore I suppose made the strongest impression upon me It was quite different from a Chicago ball though the differences were so intangiblenot consisting at all in the supper or the music or the dresses or the decorationsthat I am by no means sure that I can explain them so I beg that you will not be disappointed if you fail to learn from my idea of a London ball what a Chicago ball is like It is very easy for you to find out personally if you happen to be in Chicago

We went in a fourwheeler at about eleven oclock and as the driver
drew up before the strip of carpet that led to the door the first thing
that struck me was the little crowd of people standing waiting on
either side to watch the guests go in I never saw that in Chicagothat
patience and selfabnegation I dont think the freeborn American
citizen would find it consistent with his dignity to hang about the
portals of a party to which he had not been invited He would take
pains on the contrary to shun all appearance of wanting to go

Inside I expected to find a crowdI think balls are generally crowded
wherever they are given but I also expected to be able to get through
it in which for quite twenty minutes I was disappointed Both Lady
Torquilin and I made up our minds at one time to spend the rest of
the evening in our wraps but just as we had abandoned ourselves to this
there came a breaking and a parting among the people and a surge in one
direction which Lady Torquilin explained as we took advantage of it
by the statement that the supperroom had been opened

In the cloakroom several ladies were already preparing for departure
Do you suppose they are ill I asked Lady Torquilin as we stood
together while two of the maids repaired our damages as far as they
were able Why do they go home so early

Home child said Lady Torquilin with a withering emphasis Theyre
going on I daresay theyve got a couple more dances apiece to put in
an appearance at to night Lady Torquilin did not approve of what she
called excessive riot and never accepted more than one invitation an
evening so I was unfamiliar with London ways in this respect Presently
I had another objectlesson in the person of a lady who came in and gave
her cloak to the attendant saying Put it where you can get it easily
please Ill want it again in a quarter of an hour I thought as I
looked at her that social pleasures must be to such an one simply
a series of topographical experiments I also thought I should have
something to say when next I heard of the hurry and high pressure in
which Americans lived

Its of no use said Lady Torquilin looking at the stairs we can
never get up we might as well go with the rest and

Have some supper added somebody close behind us and Lady Torquilin
said Oh Charlie Mafferton though why she should have been surprised
was more than I could imagine for Charlie Mafferton was nearly always
at hand Wherever we went toat homes or concerts or the theatre
or sightseeing in any direction Mr Mafferton turned up either
expectedly or unexpectedly with great precision and his manner
toward Lady Torquilin was always as devoted as it could be I have
not mentioned him often before in describing my experiences and shall
probably not mention him often again because after a time I began
to take him for granted as a detail of almost everything we did Lady
Torquilin seemed to like it so I of course had no right to object
and indeed I did not particularly mind because Mr Mafferton was
always nice in his manner to me and often very interesting in his
remarks But if Lady Torquilin had not told me that she had known him in
short clothes and if I had not been perfectly certain she was far
too sensible to give her affections to a person so much younger than
herself I dont know what I would have thought

So we went with the rest and had some supper and in the anxious
interval during which Lady Torquilin and I occupied a position in the
doorway and Mr Mafferton reconnoitred for one of the little round
tables I discovered what had been puzzling me so about the house
ever since I had come into it Except for the people and the flower
decorations and a few chairs it was absolutely empty The people
furnished it so to speak moving about in the brilliancy of their
dresses and diamonds and the variety of their manners to such an
extent that I had not been able to particularise before what I felt was
lacking to this ball It was a very curious lackall the crewelwork
and Japanese bricbrac and flower lampshades that go to make up
a home and the substitute for it in the gay lights and flowers and
exuberant suppertable and dense mass of people gave me the feeling of
having been permitted to avail myself of a brilliant opportunity rather
than of being invited to share the hospitality of Lady Torquilins
friends

Has Lady Powderby just moved in I asked as we sat down around two
bottles of champagne a lot of things glaces a triple arrangement of
knives and forks and a pyramid of apoplectic strawberries

Lady Powderby doesnt live here Lady Torquilin said No Charlie
thank yousweets for you young people if you likesavouries for me
and my friend explained to me that Lady Powderby was at home at this
particular address only for this particular evening and had probably
paid a good many guineas houserent for the night after which I tried
in vain to feel a sense of personal gratitude for my strawberries which
I was not privileged even to eat with my hostesss forkthough of
course I knew that this was mere sentiment and that practically I was
as much indebted to Lady Powderby for her strawberries as if she had
grown them herself And on general grounds I was really glad to have
had the chance of attending this kind of ball which had not come within
my experience before I dont think it would occur to anybody in Chicago
to hire an empty house to give an entertainment in and though now
that I think of it Palmers Hotel is certainly often utilised for this
purpose it is generally the charity or benevolent society hop that is
given there

During supper while Lady Torquilin was telling Mr Mafferton how much
we had enjoyed the Opening and how kind his cousin had been I looked
round I dont know whether it is proper to look round at a ball in
Englandits a thing I never should have thought of doing in Chicago
where I knew exactly what I should see if I did look roundbut
the impersonal nature of Lady Powderbys ball gave me a sense of
irresponsibility to anybody and the usual code of manners seemed
a vague law without any particular applicability to present
circumstances And I was struck much struck with the thorough
businesslike concentration and singleness of purpose that I saw about
me The people did not seem much acquainted except by twos and threes
and ignored each other for the most part in a calm highlevel way
that was really educating to see But they were not without a common
sentiment and a common aimthey had all come to a ball where it
devolved upon them to dance and sup and dance againto dance and
sup as often as possible and to the greatest possible advantage This
involved a measuringup of what there was which seemed to be a popular
train of thought There was no undue levity If a joke had been made
in that supperroom it would have exploded more violently than the
champagnebottles Indeed there was as great and serious decorum as was
possible among so many human beings who all required to be fed at once
with several changes of plates I observed a great deal of behaviour and
a great similarity of itthe gentlemen were alike and the ladies were
alike except that some of the ladies were a little like the gentlemen
and some of the gentlemen were a little like the ladies This
homogeneity was remarkable to me considering how few of them seemed
to have even a bowing acquaintance with each other But the impressive
thing was the solid unity of interest and action as regarded the supper

We struggled upstairs and on the first landing met a ladyrelation of
our hostess with whom Lady Torquilin shook hands

Youll never find her said this relation referring to Lady Powderby
The Dyngeleys and the Porterhouses and the Bangley Coffins have all
come and gone without seeing her But I may just state here that we did
find her towards morning in time to say goodbye

When I say that the floor of Lady Powderbys temporary ballroom was
full I do not adequately express the fact It was repleteit ran
over if that is not too impulsive an expression for the movement of the
ladies and gentlemen who were twirling round each other upon the floor
all in one direction to the music With the exception of two or three
couples whose excited gyration seemed quite tipsy by contrast the ball
upstairs was going on with the same profound and determined action as
the ball downstairs I noticed the same universal look of concentration
the same firm or nervous intention of properly discharging the
responsibilities of the evening and the numbers of the programme on
the face of the sweet fresh debutante steadily getting pinker of the
middleaged military man dancing like a disjointed footrule of the
stout old lady in crimson silk very low in the neck who sat against
the wall The popular theory seemed to be that the dancing was something
to be Donethe consideration of enjoyment brought it to a lower plane
And it was an improving sight though sad

Mr Mafferton asked me for Numbers seven and nine and elevenall
waltzes I knew he would be obliged to out of politeness to Lady
Torquilin who had got past dancing herself but I had been dreading
it all the time I spent in watching the other men go round while Mr
Mafferton sought for a chair for her So I suggested that we should try
Number seven and see how we got on ignoring the others and saying
something weakly about my not having danced for so long and feeling
absolutely certain that I should not be able to acquit myself with the
erectnessto speak of nothing elsethat seemed to be imperative at
Lady Powderbys ball Oh I am sure we shall do very well said Mr
Mafferton And we started

I admire English dancing I am accustomed to it now and can look at a
roomful of people engaged in it without a sympathetic attack of vertigo
or a crick in my neck I think it is perhaps as good an exposition of
the unbending unswerving quality in your national character as could be
found anywhere in a small way but I do not think an American ought to
tamper with it without preliminary training

Mr Mafferton and I startedhe with confidence I with indecision You
can make the same step with a pair of scissors as Mr Mafferton made I
did it afterwards when I explained to Lady Torquilin how impossible it
was that I should have danced nine and eleven with him Compared with
it I felt that mine was a caper and the height of impropriety You will
argue from this that they do not go together well and that is quite
correct We inserted ourselves into the moving mass and I went
hopelessly round the May pole that Mr Mafferton seemed to have turned
into several times Then the room began to reel Dont you think we
had better reverse I asked I am getting dizzy Im afraid Mr
Mafferton stopped instantly and the room came right again

Original Reverse he said I dont think I ever heard of it I thought we were getting on capitally And when I explained to him that reversing meant turning round and going the other way he declared that it was quite impracticablethat we would knock everybody else over and that he had never seen it done After the last argument I did not press the matter It took very little acquaintance with Mr Mafferton to know that if he had never seen it done he never would do it We will try going back a bit he proposed instead with the result that after the next four or five turns he began to stalk away from me going I knew not whither About four minutes later we went back at my urgent request to Lady Torquilin and Mr Mafferton told her that we had hit it off admirably I think he must have thought we did because he said something about not having been quite able to catch my step at first in a way that showed entire satisfaction with his later performance which was quite natural for Mr Mafferton was the kind of person who so long as he was doing his best himself would hardly be aware whether anybody else was or not

I made several other attempts with friends of Lady Torquilin and
Mr Mafferton and a few of them were partially successful though I
generally found it advisable to sit out the latter parts of them This
when room could be found was very amusing and I noticed that it
was done all the way up two flights of stairs and in every other
conceivable place that offered two seats contiguously I was interested
to a degree in one person with whom I sat out two or three dances
running He was quite a young man not over twentyfour or five I
should thinka nephew of Lady Torquilin and an officer in the Army
living at Aldershot very handsome and wore an eyeglass which was
however quite a common distinction I must tell you more about him
again in connection with the day Lady Torquilin and I spent at Aldershot
at his invitation because he really deserves a chapter to himself But
it was he who told me at Lady Powderbys ball referring to the solid
mass of humanity that packed itself between us and the door that it
was with the greatest difficulty that he finally gained the ballroom
Couldnt get in at all at first said he and while I was standin on
the outside edge of the pavement a bobby has the confounded impudence
to tell me to move along Cant says IIm at the party

I have always been grateful to the Aldershot officer for giving me that
story to remember in connection with Lady Powderbys ball although Mr
Mafferton when I retailed it couldnt see that it was in the least
amusing Besides he said its as old as Punch But at the end
of the third dance Mr Mafferton had been sent by Lady Torquilin to look
for me and was annoyed I have no doubt by the trouble he had to
take to find me And Mr Maffertons sense of humour could never be
considered his strong point





XVII

A GREAT many other people were going to Aldershot the day we went
thereso many that the train which we were almost too late for had
nowhere two spare seats together Just at the last minute after Lady
Torquilin had decided that we must travel separately the guard unlocked
the door of a firstclass carriage occupied by three gentlemen alone
It afforded much more comfortable accommodation than the carriage Lady
Torquilin was crowded into but there was no time to tell her so I got
in by myself and sat down in the lefthand corner going backward
and prepared to enjoy the landscape The gentlemen were so much more
interesting however that I am afraid though I ostensibly looked at
the landscape I paid much more attention to them which I hope was
comparatively proper since they were not aware of it

Original They were all rather past middle age all very trim and all dressed to ride There the similarity among them ended and besides being different from one another they were all different from any American gentlemen I had ever met That is the reason they were so deeply interesting

One who sat opposite me was fair with large blue eyes and an aquiline
nose and a welldefined cleanshaven face all but his graceful
moustache He was broadshouldered and tall and muscular and lean and
he lounged illuminating his conversation with a sweet and easy smile
He looked very clever and I think he must have been told all his life
that he resembled the Duke of Wellington The one in the other corner
opposite was rosy and roundfaced with twinkling blue eyes and a grey
moustache and he made a comfortable angle with his rotund person and
the wall crossing his excellent legs

The one on my side of whom I had necessarily an imperfect view was
very grey and had a straight nose and a pair of level eyes rather pink
about the edges and carefullycut whiskers and sloping shoulders He
did not lounge at all or even cross his legs but sat bolt upright and
read the paper He looked like a person of extreme views upon propriety
and a rather bad temper The first man had the Times the second the
Standard and the third the Morning Post I think they all belonged
to the upper classes

They began to talk especially the two opposite the lean man throwing
his remarks and his easy smiles indolently across the valises on the
seat between them He spoke of the traffic in Piccadilly where a brute
of an omnibus had taken off a carriagewheel for him the day before
He was of opinion that too many omnibuses were allowed to run through
Piccadillya considerable lot too many He also found the condition
of one or two streets in that neighbourhood disgustin and was goin
to call attention to it All in cool high pleasant indolent tones

Write a letter to the Times said the other with a broad smile as
if it were an excellent joke I dont mind reading it

The first smiled gently and thoughtfully down upon his boot Will
you guarantee that anybody else does said he And they chaffed My
neighbour turned his paper impatiently and said nothing

Whatryou goin to ride today asked the first His voice was
delightfully refined

Havent a notion Believe theyve got something for me down there
Expect the worstwhich also for some unknown reason seemed to amuse
them very much

Youve heard bout Puhbelow down heah year befoh lastold Puhbelow
used to cmand th Wangers ADC wides up t Puhbelow an tells him
hes wanted at headquahtehs immediately That case says Puhbelow
Id better walk An he did said my visvis

Lord returned the other I hope it wont come to that

Its the last day I shall be able to turn out he went on ruefully

For wy

Cant get inside my uniform another year

Supuhfluous adipose tissue

Rather Attended the Leve last week an came away black in the face
At my time o life a mans got to consider his buttons Pon my word I
envy you lean dogs He addressed both his neighbour and the pinkeyed
man who took no notice of the pleasantry but folded his paper the
other way and said without looking up that that had been a very
disastrous flood in the United States

They do everything on a big scale over thayah remarked the man across
from me genially includin swindles

The roundfaced gentlemans eye kindled with new interest Were you let
in on those Kakeboygan Limiteds he said By Joveabominable Never
knew a cooler thing Must have scooped in fifty thousand

It was vey painful said the other unexcitedly By th way what
dyou think of Little Toledos

Dont know anything about em Bought a fewdaresay Ive dropped my
money

Wilkinson wanted me to buy Lunched the beast last week expectin
to get a pointer Confounded sharp scoundrel Wilkinson And this
gentleman smiled quite seraphically Still expectin I see Oneida
Centrals have reached a premium Bought a lot eight months ago for a
song Cheapah to buy em I thought than waste more money in somethin
I knew as little about Theres luck This stage of the conversation
found me reflecting upon the degree of depravity involved in getting
the better of the business capacity which made its investments on these
principles I did not meditate a defence for my fellowcountrymen but I
thought they had a pretty obvious temptation

The talk drifted upon clubs and the gentlemen expressed their
preferences Hear youre up for the Army and Navy said the rosyfaced
one

Yees Beastly bore getting in returned he of the aquiline nose
dreamily

How long

Bout two years I believe Im up again for the United Service too
Had a fit of economy in year of the Tarantillas smashyou were in
that too wehnt youan knocked off five o six o my clubs They
make no end of a wow about lettin you in again

Well the Rags good enough for me and the Lyrics convenient to
take a lady to They say the Corinthians the thing to belong to now
though said the round gentleman tentatively

If you have a taste for actresses returned the other with another
tender glance at his boot

Then it appeared from a remark from the pinkeyed one that he dined
at the Carlton four nights out of sevenstood by the Carltonhoped
he might never enter a better clubnever met a cad there in his life
Fairly lived there when he wasnt in Manchester

Dyou live in Manchester drawled the thin gentleman quite agreeably
Now what was there in that to make the pinkeyed one angry Is
Manchester a disreputable place to live in But he wasas angry as
possible The pink spread all over under his closetrimmed whiskers
and down behind his collar He answered in extremely rasping and
subindignant tones that he had a place near it and retired from the
conversation

Then the rotund gentleman stated that there were few better clubs
than the Constitutional and then what a view you could get from the
balconies Tremendous fine view he said I tell you at night when
the place is lighted up an the river in the distance

Moon inquired his companion sweetly But the stout gentlemans
robust sentiment failed him at this point and he turned the
conversation abruptly to something elsea houseparty somewhere

Have you got what they call a pleasant invitation the other asked
and the portly one said Yes in fact he had three with a smile of great
satisfaction Just then the train stopped and we all changed cars and
I rejoining Lady Torquilin lost my entertaining fellowpassengers
I was sorry it stopped at that point because I particularly wanted to
know what a houseparty and a pleasant invitation werethey seemed to
me to be idiomatic and I had already begun to collect English idioms
to take home with me In fact I should have liked to have gone on
observing the landscape from my unobtrusive corner all the way to
Aldershot if I couldthese gentlemen made such interesting incidents
to the journeythough I know I have told you that two or three times
before without making you understand in the least I am afraid how or
why they did There was a certain opulence and indifference about them
which differed from the kind of opulence and indifference you generally
see in the United States in not being in the least assumed They did not
ignore the fact of my existence in the cornerthey talked as if they
were not aware of it And they had worn the conventionalism of England
so long that it had become assort of easy uniform which they didnt
know they had on They impressed you as having always before them
unconsciously a standard of action and opinionthough their perception
of it might be as different as possibleand as conducting themselves in
very direct relation to that standard I dont say this because none of
them used bad language or smoked in my presence The restraint was
not to be defineda delicate allpervasive thing and it was closely
connected with a lack of enthusiasm upon any subject except the
approach to it the rounded gentleman made with reference to the
Constitutional view They could not be considered flippant and yet
their talk played very lightly upon the surface of their minds making
no drafts upon any reserve store of information or opinion This was odd
to me I am sure no three Americans who knew each other could travel
together in a box about six by eight without starting a theory and
arguing about it seriously or getting upon politics or throwing
themselves into the conversation in some way or other

But I have no doubt that to be impressed with such things as these
you must be brought up in Chicago where people are different Lady
Torquilin was unable to tell me anything about the gentlemen from my
description of them she said they were exactly like anybody else
and as for gambling in stocks she had no sympathy with anybody who
lostseeming to think that I had and that that was what had attracted
my attention

The young officer was at Aldershot Station to meet us looking quite a
different person in his uniform I cant possibly describe the uniform
or you would know the regiment and possibly the officer if you are
acquainted with Aldershotwhich he might not like But I may say
without fear of identifying him that he wore a red coat and looked
very handsome in itred is such a popular colour among officers in
England and so generally becoming He was a lieutenant and his name
was Oddie Pratte

By the time I found this out which was afterwards when Mr Pratte had
occasion to write two or three letters to me which he signed in
that way I had noticed how largely pet names cling to gentlemen
in Englandnot only to young gentlemen in the Army but even to
middleaged family men Mr Winterhazels name is Bertram and I should
be interested to hear what he would say if any one addressed him as
Bertie I think he would be mad as we say in America If I had ever
called him anything but Mr Winterhazelwhich I have notI would do
it myself when I return just for an experiment I dont think any
gentleman in the United States out of pinafores could be called
Bertie with impunity We would contract it into the brutal brevity
of Bert and Eddie to Ed and Willie to Will and Bobby
to Bob But it is a real pleasing feature of your civilisation this
overlapping of nursery tenderness upon maturer years and I hope it will
spread What Oddie was derived from I never got to know Mr Pratte
well enough to ask but he sustained it with more dignity than I
would have believed possible That is the remarkableat any rate a
remarkablecharacteristic of you English people You sustain everything
with dignity from your Lord Mayors Show to your farthing change You
are never in the least amused at yourselves





XVIII

AWFLY glad youve been able to come said Mr Pratte leading the
way to his dogcart quite a marked figure in his broad red shoulders
among the darkcoloured crowd at the station Theres so much going on
in the village I was afraid youd change your mind Frightful state of
funk I assure you every time the post came in Mr Pratte spoke to
Lady Torquilin but looked across at me We are considerably more simple
than this in America If a gentleman wants to say something polite to
you he never thinks of transmitting it through somebody else But your
way is much the most convenient It gives one the satisfaction of being
complimented without the embarrassment of having to reply in properly
negative terms So it was Lady Torquilin who said how sorry we should
have been to miss it and I found no occasion for remark until we were
well started Then I made the unavoidable statement that Aldershot
seemed to be a pretty place though I am afraid it did not seriously
occur to me that it was

Oh its a hole of sorts remarked Mr Pratte But to see it in its
pristine beauty you should be here when it rains Its adorable then
By that time I had observed that Mr Pratte had very blue eyes with a
great deal of laugh in them His complexion you could find in America
only at the close of the seaside season among the people who have just
come home and even then it would be patchyit would not have the solid
richness of tint that Mr Prattes had It was a wholesome complexion
and it went very well with the rest of Mr Pratte I liked its tones of
brown and red and the way it deepened in his nose and the back of his
neck In fact I might as well say in the beginning that I liked Mr
Pratte altogetherthere was something very winning about him His
manner was variable sometimes extremely flippant sometimesand then
he let his eyeglass dropprofoundly serious and sometimes when he
had it in mind preserving a level of cynical indifference that
was impressively interesting and seemed to stand for a deep and
unsatisfactory experience of life For the rest he was just a tall
young subaltern very anxious to be amused with a dog

Mr Pratte went on to say that he was about the only man in the place
not on parade There was some recondite reason for this which I have
forgotten Lady Torquilin asked him how his mother and sisters were and
he said Oh they were as fit as possible thanks according to latest
despatches which I at once mentally put down as a lovely idiom for use
in my next Chicago letter I wanted above all things to convince them
at home that I was wasting no time so far as the language was concerned
and I knew they would not understand it which was of course an
additional pleasure I would express myself very clearly about it
though I thought so as not to suggest epilepsy or anything of that
sort

Americans are nearly always interested in public buildings We are
very proud of our own and generally point them out to strangers before
anything else and I was surprised that Mr Pratte mentioned nothing of
the sort as we drove through Aldershot So the first one of any size or
importance that met my eye I asked him about That I suppose is
your jail I said with polite interest as we came in sight of a long
building with that simplicity of exterior that always characterises
jails Our subaltern gave vent to a suppressed roar What is she saying
now asked Lady Torquilin who had not been paying attention

She saysoh I say Auntie what a score Miss Wick has just pointed
out that building as Aldershot jail

Isnt it said I

Im afraid Miss Wick is pullin our leg Auntie

Now I was in the back seat and what could have induced Mr Pratte to
charge me with so unparalleled and impossible a familiarity I couldnt
imagine not being very far advanced in the language at the time but
when Mr Pratte explained that the buildings I referred to were the
officers quarters with his own colonels at one endand Great
Scott said Mr Pratte going off again What would the old man say to
thatI felt too much overcome by my own stupidity to think about
it I have since realised that I was rather shocked It was of course
impossible to mention public buildings again in any connection and
although I spent a long and agreeable day at Aldershot if you were to
ask me whether it had so much as a town pump I couldnt tell you But
I must say I am not of the opinion that it had To speak American it
struck me as being rather a onehorse town though nothing could be
nicer than I found it as a military centre

We drove straight out of town to the paradeground over a road that
wound through ruggedlooking broken fields yellow with your wonderful
flaming gorse and furze which struck me as contrasting oddly with
the neatness of your landscapes generally When I remarked upon their
uncultivated state Mr Pratte said with some loftiness that military
operations were not advantageously conducted in standing cornmeaning
wheatand I decided for the rest of the day to absorb information as
far as possible without inquiring for it

It was a lovely dayno clouds no dust nothing but blue sky and
sunshine on the gorse and plenty of people all of whom seemed to have
extreme views upon the extraordinary fineness of the weather were on
their way to the paradeground chiefly driving in dogcarts Whenever we
passed a lady in anything more ambitious Mr Pratte invariably saluted
very nicely indeed and told Lady Torquilin that she was the wife of
Colonel Soandso commanding the somethingth something And I noticed
all through the day what a great deal of consideration these ladies
received from everybody and what extraordinary respect was accorded to
their husbands I have no doubt it is a class distinction of yours and
very proper but I could not help thinking of the number of colonels and
their families we have at home and how little more we think of them on
that account Poppas head man in the bakingpowder business for years
was a colonelColonel Canister so is poppa himselfand I never knew
either of them show that they thought anything of it I suppose mommas
greatest friend is Mrs Colonel Pabbly but that is because their tastes
are similar and their families about the same age For that matter I
daresay onethird of the visitingcards momma receives have Colonel
between the Mrs and the last name It is really no particular
distinction in America

We were rather late and all the best places had been taken up by the
dogcarts of other people They formed an apparently unbroken front or
more properly back wherever we wanted to get in By some extraordinary
means however more as a matter of course than anything elseit
couldnt have been done in AmericaMr Pratte inserted his dogcart in
an extremely advantageous position and I saw opposite and far off
the long long double line of soldiers stretching and wavering as
the country dipped and swelled under the sky In a minute said Mr
Pratte youll hear the furious joyand an instant later there came
splitting and spitting against the blue from east to west and from
west to east the chasing white smokejets of the feu de joie You have
a few very good jokes in England

It seemed to me that two of the bands which defied each other for
the rest of the morning began playing at that instant to prevent any
diminution in the furious joy while the long line of soldiers broke up
into blocks each block going off somewhere by itself and Mr Pratte
told Lady Torquilin about a dance in town the night before where he met
a lot of people he loved

Was the fair and only one there Lady Torquilin inquired with
archness and Mr Prattes countenance suddenly became rueful as he
dropped his eyeglass Yes he said but theres a frost onwe
dont play with each other any more And I believe other confidences
followed which I did not feel entitled to hear so I divided my
attention between the two bands and the parade One band stood still at
a little distance and played as hard as possible continually and every
regiment sent its own band gloriously on ahead of it with the colonel
generally getting the full significance out of a Scotch jig which Mr
Pratte said was the marchpast It made a most magnificently effective
noise

I hope the person for whose benefit that parade was chiefly intendedI
believe there is always some such person in connection with paradeswas
as deeply impressed with it as I was It was the first time I had ever
seen English soldiers in bulk and they presented a threatening solidity
which I should think would be very uninteresting to the enemy There are
more interstices in our regimentsI think it must be admitted that we
are nationally thinner than you are Besides what we are still in the
habit of calling our recent unpleasantness happened about a quarter of
a century ago and I shouldnt think myself that a taste for blood could
survive that period of peace and comfort to be very obvious Certainly
Chicago parades had not prepared me for anything so warlike as this Not
that I should encourage anybody to open hostilities with us however
Though we are thin we might be found lively

The cavalry regiments were splendid with the colonels horse as
conscious as anybody of what was expected of him as the colonels
horse stepping on ahead and particularly the Lancers with their gay
little pennons flying but there was not the rhythmic regularity in
their movement that was so beautiful to see in the infantry
coming after Lady Torquilin found it very absurdthere were so
admirablethat the parade was that long saw from the rear as once but
it seemed to of martial order in it That and the swing of gleam of the
sun on many points to notice that were more thing I liked best in the
whole quick instant crinkle that we every man bent his knee at me to
have the whole essence and to hold great fascination the Highlanders
kilts and the their philabegs and the pride of their marching

That Aldershot Highland regiment with its screaming bagpipes seemed
to my Chicago imagination to have marched straight out of Inkermann
Then came the South Wales Borderers and I heard the story of the
Isandula colours with the Queens little gold wreath above them that
went preciously furled in the middle I wished thenthough it is not
consistent with the Monroe doctrinethat we had a great standing army
with traditions and a constant possibility of foreign fighting It
may be discouraging to the increase of the male population but it
encourages sentiment and is valuable on that account

So they all came and passed and went and came and passed and went
again three timesthe whole ten thousand cavalry infantry artillery
commissariat ambulance doctors mules and allwith a great dust and
much music and a tremendous rattling and bumping when the long waggons
came at the rear of which a single soldier sat in each with his legs
hanging down looking very seasick and unhappy And they showed me a
princesubaltern walking through the dust beside his company with the
others Nobody seemed to see anything remarkable in this but me so I
thought it best to display no surprise But the nominal nature of some
privileges in England began to grow upon me I also saw a mulea stout
wellgrown talented mulewho did not wish to parade I was glad of
the misbehaviour of that mule It reduced to some extent the gigantic
proportions of my respect for the British Army

I met some of the colonels and their wives and daughters afterwards
and in most cases I was lost in admiration of the military tone of the
whole family Chicago colonels often have very little that is strikingly
military about them and their families nothing at all But here the
daughters carried themselves erect moved stiffly but briskly and
turned on their heels as sharply as if they were on the paradeground I
suppose it would be difficult to live in such constant association with
troops and barracks and salutes and sentries and the word of command
without assimilating somewhat of the distinctive charm of these things
and the way some of the colonels ladies clipped their sentences and
held their shoulders and otherwise identified themselves with their
regiments was very taking It explained itself further when I saw
the quarters in which one or two of them kept housevery pleasant
quarters where we received most interesting and delightful hospitality
But it would be odd if domesticity in a series of rooms very square
and very similar with C O painted in black letters over all their
doors did not develop something a little different from the ordinary
English lady accustomed to cornices and portires

Then came lunch at the mess at which as the colonel took care of Lady
Torquilin I had the undivided attention of Mr Oddie Pratte which I
enjoyed Mr Pratte was curious upon the subject of American girls
at homehe told me he began to believe himself misinformed about
themseriously and dropping his eyeglass He would like to
know accuratelyunder a false impression one made such awkward
mistakeswell for instance if it were true that they were up to all
sorts of games at home how was it they were all so deucedly solemn when
they came over here Mr Pratte hoped I wouldnt be offendedof course
he didnt mean that I was solemnbutwell I knew what he meantI
must know And wouldnt I have some more sugar for those strawberries
I like crowds of sugar dont you said Mr Oddie Pratte Another
thing he had always been told that they immediately wanted to see
Whitechapel Now he had asked every American girl hed met this season
whether she had seen Whitechapel and not one ofem had

He wasnt going to ask me on that account They didnt as a rule seem
to see the joke of the thing Mr Pratte would like to know if I had
ever met the MClures of New YorkNellie MClure was a great pal of
hisand was disappointed that I hadnt The conversation turned to
India whither Mr Prattes regiment was ordered to proceed immediately
and I received a good deal of information as to just how amusing life
might be made there from Mr Pratte They say a man marries as soon
as he learns enough AngloIndian to propose in he remarked with
something like anticipative regret First dance apt to be fatalbound
to bowl over before the end of the season Simla girl is known to be
irresistible And Lady Torquilin catching this last put in her oar in
her own inimitable way Youre no nephew of mine Oddie said she if
you cant say No Whereat I was very sorry for Oddie and forgave him
everything

There was tea on the lawn afterwards and bagpipes to the full
lungpower of three Highlanders at once walking up and down and
beating time on the turf with one foot in a manner that was simply
extraordinary considering the nature of what they were playing and
conversation with more Aldershot ladies followed by an inspection in
a body of Mr Prattes own particular corner of the barracks full of
implements of war and charming photographs and the performance of Mr
Prattes intellectual small dog That ended the Aldershot parade We
have so few parades of any sort in America except when somebody of
importance diesand then they are apt to be depressingthat I was
particularly glad to have seen it

POPPAS interests in London necessitated his having lawyers
thereMessrs Pink Pink  Co of Cheapside If you know New York you
will understand me when I say that I had always thought Cheapside a kind
of Bowery probably full of secondhand clothing shops and icecream
parloursthe last place I should think of looking for a respectable
firm of solicitors in especially after cherishing the idea all my life
that London lawyers were to be found only in Chancery Lane But that
was Messrs Pink  Pinks address and the mistake was one of the large
number you have been kind enough to correct for me

It was a matter of some regret to poppa that Messrs Pink  Pink were
bachelors and could not very well be expected to exert themselves for
me personally on that account two Mrs Pinks he thought might have
done a little to make it pleasant for me in London and would probably
have put themselves out more or less to do it But there was no Mrs
Pink so I was indebted to these gentlemen for money only which they
sent me whenever I wrote to them for it by arrangement with poppa I
was surprised therefore to receive one morning an extremely polite
note from Messrs Pink  Pink begging me to name an afternoon when
it would be convenient for me to call at their office in order that
Messrs Pink  Pink might have the honour of discussing with me a matter
of private business important to myself I thought it delightfully
exciting and wrote at once that I would come next day I speculated
considerably in the meantime as to what the important private matter
could possibly besince beyond my address Messrs Pink  Pink knew
nothing whatever of my circumstances in Londonbut did not tell Lady
Torquilin for fear she would think she ought to come with me and
nothing spoils an important private matter like a third person

st Floor Messrs Dickson  Dawes Architects nd Floor Norwegian
Life Insurance Co rd floor Messrs Pink  Pink Solicitors read
the framed directory inside the door in black letters on a yellow
ground I looked round in vain for an elevatorboy though the narrow
dark little twisting stairway was so worn that I might have known that
the proprietors were opposed to this innovation I went from floor
to floor rejoicing At last I had found a really antique interior in
London there was not a cobweb lacking in testimony It was the very
first I had come across in my own private investigations and I had
expected them all to be like this

Four or five clerks were writing at high desks in the room behind the
frostedglass door with Pink  Pink on it There was a great deal
of the past in this room also and in its associationsimpossible to
realise in Americawhich I found gratifying The clerks were nearly all
elderly for one thinggreyheaded men Since then Ive met curates
of about the same date The curates astonished me even more than the
clerks A curate is such a perennially young person with us You would
find about as many aged schoolboys as elderly curates in America I
suppose our climate is more favourable to rapid development than yours
and they become fullfledged clergymen or lawyers after a reasonable
apprenticeship If not they must come within the operation of some
evolutionary law by which they disappear America is a place where there
is very little room for anachronisms

Beside the elderly clerks the room had an air of old leather and three
large windows with yellow blinds pinned upin these days of automatic
rollers Through the windows I noticed the cheerful chimneys and spires
of London EC rising out of that lovely atmospheric tone of yellow
which is so becoming to them and down belowif I could only have
got near enough I am certain I should have seen a small dismantled
graveyard with mossy tombstones of different sizes a long way out of
the perpendicular I have become accustomed to finding graveyards in
close connection with business enterprise in London and they appeal
to me It is very nice of you to let them stay just where they were put
originally when you are so crowded

Original At home there isnt a dead person in existence so to speak that would have a chance in a locality like Cheapside

And they must suggest to you all sorts of useful and valuable things
about the futility of ambition and the deceitfulness of riches down
there under your very noses as it were whenever you pause to look at
them I can quite understand your respect for them even in connection
with what EC frontage prices must be and I hope though I cant be
sure that there was one attached to the offices in Cheapside of Messrs
Pink  Pink

The clerks all looked up with an air of inquiry when I went in and I
selected the only one who did not immediately duck to his work again for
my interrogation It was an awkward interrogation to make and I made
it awkwardly Are the Mr Pinks in I asked for I did not know in the
least how many of them wanted to see me

I believe so miss said the elderly clerk politely laying down his
pen Would it be Mr A Pink or Mr W W Pink

I said I really didnt know

Ah In that case it would be Mr A Pink Shouldnt you say
soturning to the less mature clerk who responded loftily from a
great distance and without looking Probably Whereupon the elderly
one got down from his stool and took me himself to the door with Mr
A Pink on it knocked spoke to someone inside then ushered me into
the presence of Mr A Pink and withdrew

The room I regret to say did not match its surroundings and could
not have been thought of in connection with a graveyard It was quite
modern with a raised leather wallpaper and revolving chairs I noticed
this before I saw the tall thin depressedlooking gentleman who had
risen and was bowing to me at the other end of it He was as bald as
possible and might have been fifty with long grey sidewhiskers that
fell upon a suit of black very much wrinkled where Mr Pink did not
fill it out His mouth was abruptly turned down at the corners with
lines of extreme reserve about it and whatever complexion he might have
had originally was quite gone leaving only a modified tone of oldgold
behind it Dear me I thought there can be nothing interesting or
mysterious here Mr Pink first carefully ascertained whether I was
Miss Wick of Chicago after which he did not shake hands as I had
vaguely expected him to do being poppas solicitor but said Pray
be seated Miss Wickand we both sat down in the revolving chairs
preserving an unbroken gravity

You have been in London some weeks I believe Miss Wick said Mr A
Pink tentatively He did not know quite how long because for the first
month I had plenty of money without being obliged to apply for it I
smiled and said Yes with an inflection of selfcongratulation I was
very curious but saw no necessity for giving more information than was
actually asked for

Yourahfather wrote us that you were coming over alone That must
have required great courage on the part ofhere Mr Pink cleared his
throatso young a lady and Mr Pink smiled a little narrow dreary
smile

Oh no I said it didnt Mr Pink

You areahquite comfortable I hope in Cadogan Mansions I think
it is Cadogan Mansions is it notYes

Very comfortable indeed thank you Mr Pink They are comparatively
modern and the elevator makes it seem more or less like home

Mr Pink brightened he evidently wished me to be discursive Indeed
he saidYees

Yes I returned when I have time I always use the elevator

That is not I think the address of the lady your father mentioned to
us as your only relative in London Miss Wick Oh no I responded
cheerfully Mrs Cummers Portheris lives in HalfMoon Street Mr
Pink

Ah so I understand Pardon the inquiry Miss Wick but was there not
some expectation on your fathers part that you would pass the time of
your visit in London with Mrs Portheris

On all our parts Mr Pink But it vanished the day after I
arrivedand I could not help smiling as I remembered the letter I had
written from the Mtropole telling the Wick family about my reception by
my affectionate relation

Mr Pink smiled too a little doubtfully as well as drearily this time
He did not seem to know quite how to proceed

Pardon me again Miss Wick but there must be occasions I should
think when you would feel yourahcomparative isolationand Mr
Pink let one of his grey whiskers run through his long thin hand

Very seldom I said there is so much to see in London Mr Pink
Even the storewindows are entertaining to a strangerand I wondered
more than ever what was coming

I seeI see You make little expeditions to various points of
interestthe Zoological Gardens the Crystal Palace and so forth

It began to be like the dialogues in the oldfashioned readingbooks
carefully marked I Q and A

 Yes I said I do I havent seen the Zoo yet but Ive seen Mrs Por there I stopped knowing that Mr Pink could not be expected to perceive the sequence of my ideas

But he seemed to conclude that he had ascertained as much as was
necessary I think Miss Wick he said we must come to the point at
once You have not been in England long and you may or may not be aware
of the extreme difficulty which attacheserto obtainingthat is to
say which Amerforeigners find in obtaining anything like a correct
idea ofof social institutions here To a person I may say without
excellent introductions it is generally speaking impossible

I said I had heard of this difficulty

I do not know whether you personally have any curiosity upon this
point but

I hastened to say that I had a great deal

But I should say that it was probable There are few persons of your
intelligence Miss Wick I venture to hazard by whom a knowledge of
English society gained upon what might be termed a footing of intimacy
would fail to be appreciated

I bowed It was flattering to be thought intelligent by Mr Pink

The question now resolves itself to come as I have said straight to
the point Miss Wick into whether you would or would not care to take
steps to secure it

That would depend I should think upon the nature of the steps Mr
Pink I may as well ask you immediately whether they have anything to do
with Miss Purkiss

Nothing whatevernothing whatever Mr Pink hastened to assure me I
do not know the lady The steps which have recommended themselves to
me for you would be taken upon aupon a basis of mutual accommodation
Miss Wick involving remuneration of course upon your side

Oh said I comprehendingly

And in connection with a client of our ownan old and I may say
a highlyesteemedand Mr Pink made a little respectful forward
inclination of his neckclient of our own I left the burden of
explanation wholly to Mr Pink contenting myself with looking amiable
and encouraging

A widow of Lord Bandobust said Mr Pink with an eye to the effect of
this statement The effect was badI could not help wondering how many
Lord Bandobust had and said Really with an effort to conceal it

Lady Bandobust somewhat late in lifethis of course is
confidential Miss Wickfinds herself in a position toto appreciate
any slight addition to her income His lordships rather peculiar
willbut I need not go into that It is perhaps sufficient to say
that Lady Bandobust is in a position to give you every advantage Miss
Wickevery advantage

This was fascinating and I longed to hear more It seems a little
indefinite said I to Mr Pink

It does certainlyyou are quite right Miss Wickit does Beyond
approaching you however and ascertaining your views I am not
instructed to act in the matter Ascertaining your views in particular
I should say as regards the sum mentioned by Lady Bandobust as aa
proper equivalentahem

What is her ladyships charge I inquired

Lady Bandobust would expect three hundred pounds My client wishes it
to be understood that in naming this figure she takes into consideration
the fact that the season is already well opened Mr Pink said Of
course additional time must be allowed to enable you to write to your
parents

I see I said it does not strike me as exorbitant Mr Pink
considering what Lady Bandobust has to sell

Mr Pink smiled rather uncomfortably You Americans are so humorous
he said with an attempt at affability

Welldrawing both whiskers through his hand conclusively and
suddenly standing upwill you step this way Miss Wick My client has
done me the honour of calling in person about this matter and as your
visits oddly enough coincide you will be glad of the opportunity of
going into details with her And Mr A Pink opened the door leading
into the room of Mr W W Pink I was taken by surprise but am afraid
I should have gone in even after time for mature deliberation I was so

Original ADY BANDOBUST may I have the honour of introducing Miss Wick of Chicago said Mr Pink solemnly bowing as if he himself were being introduced to somebody I could not do better I am sure Miss Wick than leave you in Lady Bandobusts handswith which masterstroke of politeness Mr Pink withdrew leaving me as he said in Lady Bandobusts hands She was a little old woman in black with sharp eyes a rather large hooked nose and a discontented mouth over which hovered an expression of being actively bored She had sloping shoulders and little thin fingers in gloves much too long for them and her bonnet dated back five seasons Her whole appearance without offering any special point for criticism suggested that appreciation of any pecuniary advantage of which Mr Pink had spoken though her manner gave me definitely to understand that she did not care one jot about it She was looking out of the window when Mr Pink and I came in and after acknowledging my bow with a small perfunctory smile a halfeffort to rise and a vague vertebral motion at the back of her neck she looked out of the window again I am convinced that there was nothing in the view that could possibly interest her yet constantly in the course of our conversation Lady Bandobust looked out of the window She was the most uninterested person I have had the pleasure of talking to in England



I said it was a lovely day

Yes said Lady Bandobust Mr Pink tells me you are an American
Miss Wick though anybody could see that much He knows your father I
believe

Not personally I think I returned Poppa has never visited England
Lady Bandobust

Perhaps we had better say financially thenknows him financially

I daresay that is all that is necessary I said innocently at the
time though I have since understood Lady Bandobusts reason for looking
at me so sharply

You come from Chinchinnatti I understand from Mr Pink she
continued

I beg your pardon Oh Cincinatti No from Chicago Lady Bandobust

I understood from Mr Pink that you came from Chinchinnattithe place
where people make millions in tinned pork I had a nephew there
for seven years so I ought to know something about it said Lady
Bandobust with some asperity But if you say you are from Chickago I
have no doubt you are right

Mr Pink informed me continued Lady Bandobust that he thought
you might feel able to afford to see a little of English society Ive
noticed that Americans generally like to do that if they can

I said I was sure it would be interesting

It is very difficult said Lady Bandobustextremely difficult It is
impossible that you should know how difficult it is

I remarked modestly by way of reply that I believed few things worth
having were easy to get

Lady Bandobust ignored the generalisation As Mr Pink has probably
told you it costs money said she with another little concessive
smile

Then perhaps it is not so difficult after all I replied amiably

Lady Bandobust gave me another sharp look Only you rich Americans
can afford to say that she said But Mr Pink has told me that the
expense would in all likelihood be a matter of indifference to your
people That of course is important

Poppa doesnt scrimp I said He likes us to have a good time

Regardless said Lady Bandobustregardless of the cost That is very
liberal

Americans she went on in English society are very fortunate They
are always considered asas Americans you understand

Im afraid I dont said I

And I think on the whole they are rather liked Yes generally
speaking I think I may say they are liked

I tried to express my gratification

As a rule said Lady Bandobust absently they spend so much money in
England

There can be no doubt of the advantages of an experience of English
society she continued rather as if I had suggested one To a young
lady especially it is invaluableit leads to so much I dont know
quite to what extent you would expect Here Lady Bandobust paused
as if waiting for data on which to proceed

I would expect I repeated not quite understanding

But I think I could arrange a certain number of balls say four one or
two dinnersyou wouldnt care much about dinners though I dare say
a few good at homes a Saturday or so at Hurlinghampossibly Ascot
but of course you know everything would depend upon yourself

I could hardly expect you to make me enjoy myself Lady Bandobust I
said That altogether depends upon ones own capacity for pleasure as
you say

Oh altogether she returned Well we might say six
ballsthoroughly good onesand Lady Bandobust looked at me for a
longer time together than she had yetand possibly the Royal Inclosure
at Ascot I say possibly because it is very difficult to get And a
houseparty to finish up with which really ought to be extra as it
doesnt properly belong to a London season but if I can at all see my
way to it Lady Bandobust went on Ill put it into the three hundred
There are the Allspices who have just bought Lord Freretons place in
WiltsI could take anybody there

Your friends must be very obliging Lady Bandobust said I

The Private View is over said Lady Bandobust but there is the
Academy Soiree in June and the Royal Colonial Institute and a few
things like that

It sounds charming I remarked

We might do something about the Fourinhand Lady Bandobust
continued with some impatience

Yes I said

There was a pause in which I cast about me for some way of escape I
felt that my interest in Lady Bandobust was exhausted and that I
could not pretend to entertain her scheme any longer with selfrespect
Besides by this time I cordially hated her But I could think of no
formula to retreat under and resigned myself to sit there helplessly
and defend myself as best I could until I was dismissed

Lady Bandobust produced her last card The Duchess of Dudlington gives
a fte on the twelfth she said throwing it as it were upon the
table I should probably be able to take you there

The Duchess of Dudlington said I in pure stupidity

Yes And she is rather partial to Americans for some extraordinary
reason or another The conversation flagged again

Presentationif that is what you are thinking ofwould be extra Miss
Wick Lady Bandobust stated firmly

Ohhow much extra Lady Bandobust

My prospective patroness did not hesitate a minute Fifty pounds she
said and looked at me inquiringly

II dont think I was thinking of it Lady Bandobust I said I felt
mean as we say in America

You were not Well said she judicially I dont know that I would
advise the outlay It is a satisfactory thing to have done of course
but not nearly so essential as it used to benothing like You can get
on without it And as you say fifty pounds is fifty pounds

I knew I hadnt said that but found it impossible to assert the fact

Miss Boningsbill whom I took out last season I did present Lady
Bandobust continued but she went in for everythingperhaps more
extensively than you would be disposed to do It might facilitate
mattersgive you an idea perhapsif I were to tell you my
arrangements with Miss Boningsbill

I should like to hear them I said

She did not live with meof course chaperonage does not imply
residence you understand that When she went out with me she called for
me in her brougham She had a brougham by the month and a landau for
the park I should distinctly advise you to do the same I would in
fact make the arrangement for you I know a very reliable man Lady
Bandobust paused for my thanks

Generally speaking Miss Boningsbill and I went out together but when
I found this particularly inconvenient she took one carriage and I the
other though she always had her choice I stipulated only to take her
to the park twice a week but if nothing interfered I went oftener
Occasionally I took her to the playthat bores me though I hope you
are not particularly fond of the theatre And then she usually found it
less expensive to get a box as there were generally a few other people
who could be asked with advantagefriends of my own She had a box at
Ascot too of course Lady Bandobust went on looking down her nose
at a fly in the corner of the windowpane but that is a matter of
detail

Of course I said because I could think of nothing else to say

I gave her a ball Lady Bandobust continued that is to say cards
were sent out in my name That was rather bungled thoughso many
friends of mine begged for invitations for friends of theirs that I
didnt know half the people And Miss Boningsbill of course knew
nobody Miss Boningsbill was dissatisfied about the cost too I was
foolish enough to forget to tell her beforehand Everything came from my
own particular tradespeople and naturally nothing was cheap I never
niggle said Lady Bandobust turning her two little indifferent black
eyes full upon me

Miss Boningsbill insisted on having her name on the cards as well
she said Lady Bandobust and Miss Boningsbill you understand That I
should not advisevery bad form I call it

She was married in October Lady Bandobust continued casually The
second son of Sir Banbury Slattethe eldest had gone abroad for his
health I knew the Banbury Slattes extremely wellexcellent family

Miss Boningsbill Lady Bandobust went on absently had nothing like
your figure

Was she an American I asked

NoManchester answered Lady Bandobust laconically

Cottonspinners

My dressmaker tells me she finds a marked difference between English
and American figures I remarked but I am afraid it is not to our
advantage We are not nearly so fine as you are

Ah said Lady Bandobust Who is your dressmaker she asked with
interest

I spoke of the firm whose place of business though not mentioned in
any guidebook I had found to repay many visits

Oh those people said Lady Bandobust Dear I call them Smart
enough for evening frocks but certainly not to be depended upon for
anything else I should strongly advise you to try Miss Pafty in Regent
Street and say I sent you And for millinery do let me recommend
Madame Marie I would give you a note to her An excessively clever
womanpersonal friend of my own A husband and two sons to support so
she makes bonnets I believe the Princess goes to her regularly And you
pay very little more than you do anywhere else And now with regard to
our little scheme what do you think Miss Wick

Really Lady Bandobust said I I am afraid I must think about it A
decided negative was an utter impossibility at the time

Ah said Lady Bandobust I perhaps you think my terms a little
highjust a trifle more than you expected perhaps Well suppose we
say two hundred and fifty

I had no expectations whatever about it Lady Bandobust I said I
knew nothing of it up to about an hour ago

Two hundred said Lady Bandobust

I am afraid I have no idea of the value ofof such things Lady
Bandobust I faltered

I can bring it as low as one hundred and fifty she returned but it
would not be quite the same Miss Wickyou could not expect that



The rest of the conversation which I find rather painful to call
to memory may perhaps be imagined from the fact that Lady Bandobust
finally brought her offer down to seventyfive pounds at which point I
escaped taking her address promising to write her my decision in the
course of a day or two and feeling more uncomfortably contemptible than
ever before in my life We happened to be making visits in Park Lane
next day and as Lady Bandobust lived near there I took the note
myself thinking it would be more polite And I found the locality
in spite of its vicinity to Park Lane quite extraordinary for Lady
Bandobust to have apartments in

I met Lady Bandobust once again It was at an at home given by Lord
and Lady Mafferton where everybody was asked to meet a certain
distinguished traveller Oddly enough I was introduced to her and we
had quite a long chat But I noticed that she had not caught my name as
my hostess pronounced itshe called me Miss Winter during the whole
of our conversation and seemed to have forgotten that we had ever seen
each other before which was disagreeable of her in my opinion

I WENT to Ascot with the Bangley CoffinsMr Mrs and the two Misses
Bangley Coffin I didnt know the Bangley Coffins very well but they
were kind enough to ask Lady Torquilin if I might go with them and Lady
Torquilin consented with alacrity You couldnt go away from England
without seeing Ascot said she It would be a sin Its far too much
riot for me besides I cant bear to see the wretched horses If they
would only learn to race without beating the poor beasties To say
nothing of the expense which I call enormous So by all means go with
the Bangley Coffins childtheyre lively peopleI daresay youll
enjoy yourself

Lady Torquilin was surprised and disappointed however when she
learned that the party would go by train I wonder at them she said
referring to the Bangley Coffins they know such a lot of people I
would have said they were morally certain to be on somebodys drag
Shall you care to go by train Whereupon I promptly assured Lady
Torquilin that I was only too happy to go any way

So we started the morning of the Gold Cup day I and the Bangley
Coffins I may as well describe the Bangley Coffins in the hope that
they may help to explain my experiences at Ascot I have to think
of Mrs Bangley Coffin very often myself when I try to look back
intelligently upon our proceedings

Mrs Bangley Coffin was tall with a beautiful figure and pale gold
hair The Misses Bangley Coffin were also tall with prospectively
beautiful figures and pale gold hair I never saw such a resemblance
between mother and daughters as there was between the Misses Bangley
Coffin and their mamma They sat up in the same way their shoulders had
the same slope their elbows the same angle The same lines developed
on the countenance of Mrs Bangley Coffin were undeveloped on the
countenances of the Misses Bangley Coffin Except in some slight matter
of nose or eyes Mr Bangley Coffin hardly suggested himself in either
of the young ladies When they spoke it was in their mothers voice and
in their mothers mannera manner that impressed you for the moment
as being the only one in the world Both they and their mamma had on
dresses which it was perfectly evident they had never worn before and
of which they demanded my opinion with a frankness that surprised me
What do you think said they of our Ascot frocks I admired them
very much they represented amongst them nearly all the fashionable
novelties and yet they had a sort of conventional originality if I may
say such a thing which was extremely striking They seemed satisfied
with my applause but promptly fell upon me for not meriting applause
myself We saw you they said unitedly in that frock last Sunday in
the parkand there was a distinct reproach in the way they said it
Its quite charming they assured meand it wasbut its not as if
you hadnt quantities of them Do you mean to say Lady Torquilin didnt
tell you you ought to have a special frock for Ascot She said I
should do very well in this I declared and that it would be a sin to
buy another I had much better give the money to Dr Barnardo Whereat
Mrs Bangley Coffin and the two Misses Bangley Coffin looked at one
another and remarked How like Lady Torquilin

I didnt give it to Dr Barnardo I continuedto which Mrs Bangley
Coffin rejoined in parenthesis I should hope not but Im glad
Lady Torquilin did not advise me to get an Ascot frock though yours are
very pretty I feel that I couldnt have sustained oneI havent the
personality And indeed this was quite true It occurred to me often
again through the day I could not have gone about inside an Ascot frock
without feeling to some extent the helpless and meaningless victim of
it The Bangley Coffin girls thought this supreme nonsense and declared
that I could carry anything off and Mrs

Bangley Coffin said with pretended severity that it was not a
question of feeling but of looking but they united in consoling me so
successfully that I at last believed myself dressed to perfection for
Ascotif I had only worn something else to the park the Sunday before

Original The husband and father of the Bangley Coffins was a short squareshouldered gentleman with bushy eyebrows a large moustache plaid trousers and a grey tailcoat that was a very tight fit round the waist He had an expression of deep sagacity and he took from an inner pocket and fondled now and then a case containing six very large brown cigars His look of peculiar anticipative intelligence combined with the cigars gave me the idea that we should not be overburdened with Mr Bangley Coffins society during the daywhich proved to be a correct one

It did not seem to me in spite of what Lady Torquilin had said that
it was at all unpopular to go to Ascot by rail Trains were leaving the
station every four or five minutes all full of people who preferred
that way of going and our own car which was what I believe you
call a saloon carriage had hardly an empty seat They looked nice
respectable people too nearly all in Ascot frocks though not perhaps
particularly interesting What surprised me in connection with the ride
was the length of it it was not a ride as I had somehow expected of
twenty minutes or half an hour from London but a journey of I forget
how many interminable hours And what surprised me in connection
with the people was their endurance of it They did not fuss or grow
impatient or consult their watches as the time dragged by they sat
up calm and placid and patient and only looked occasionally for
refreshment at their Ascot frocks They seemed content to take an
enormous amount of trouble for the amusement which might be supposed to
be tickling their fancy at the other end of the tripif there was any
other endto take it unshrinkingly and seriously It gave me an idea of
how difficult it is to be amused in Englandunless you are a foreigner
Ascot to them was no light matter and to me it was such a very light
matter I tried to imagine any fifty Americans of my acquaintance
dressing up in their best clothes and spending six or seven hours of
a day in protracted railway journeys for the sake of a little fun
in between and I failed Its as much as we would do to inaugurate a
president or bury a general who saved the Union We would consider the
terms high But of course it is impossible for me to say how we might
behave if we had Distinguished Occasions with Royal Inclosures inside
them

We started with a sense of disappointment which seemed to come in
through the windows and envelop the Bangley Coffins because some
people they had expected failed to appear upon the platform Mr
Bangley Coffin looked particularly depressed Dont see how the deuce
were going to arrange he said to Mrs Bangley Coffin with unction
Oh theres sure to be somebody Joey love she returned cheerfully
and in any case you see we have you To which Mr Bangley Coffin
gave a dubious and indistinct assent I did not get on well with Mr
Bangley Coffin He seemed to mean well but he had a great many phrases
which I did not in the least understand and to which he invariably
added As you say in America It was never by any chance a thing we
did say in America but nothing could make Mr Bangley Coffin believe
that I cant say that we had much general conversation either but in
what there was I noticed great goodfeeling between the Misses Bangley
Coffins and their mamma

The bonnet of that Israelite at the other end of the carriage would
suit you to a T mummie one of them remarked in joke The bonnet was
a terrible affair in four shades of heliotrope

Yes replied Mrs Bangley Coffin smiling quite goodnaturedly
thats about my form

The Bangley Coffins were all form Form for them regulated existence
It was the allcompelling law of the spheres the test of all human
action and desire Good form was the ultimate expression of their
respect bad form their final declaration of contempt Perhaps I
should misjudge the Bangley Coffins if I said form was their conscience
and I dont want to misjudge themthey were very pleasant to me But I
dont think they would have cared to risk their eternal salvation upon
any religious tenets that were not entirely comme il fautI mean the
ladies Bangley Coffin The head of their house twisted his moustache and
seemed more or less indifferent

There is no doubt that in the end we did get to Ascot and left our
dustcloaks in charge of that obliging middleaged person who is to
be found in every ladies waitingroom in England There was some
discussion as to whether we should or should not leave our dustcloaks
with herthey were obviously unbecoming but obviously also it might
rain However in the end we did Mrs Bangley Coffin thought we might
trust to Providence and Providence proved itself worthy of Mrs Bangley
Coffins confidence

Again as we joined the crowd that surged out of the station I noticed
that look of anxious expectancy on the face of the Bangley Coffin
family It was keener than before and all embracing I even fancied I
noticed an understood division of surveyan arrangement by which Mr
Bangley Coffin looked to the north and Mrs Bangley Coffin to the
south one young lady to the east and the other to the west We really
must keep an eye open said Mr Bangley Coffin Coming this way Oh
Hullo Pipply old man Hare you with extreme cordiality to a short
very stout gentleman in grey with a pink face and a hooked nose and a
white moustache and a bluespotted necktiea New Yorker I was sure
before he spoke Pipply responded with very moderate transports and
shook hands hastily with the ladies attached to Mr Bangley Coffin
Mrs Pipplys with you I see continued Mr Bangley Coffin joyously
and that charming sister of hers Kitty we must see whether they have
forgotten us mustnt weand he and Kitty advanced upon two very
muchaccented fair ladies in frilled muslins and large flowery hats
They were dressed as fashionably as Bond Street could dress them and
they were as plump and pretty as could be but perhaps just a little too
big and blue of eye and pinkandwhite of complexion quite to satisfy
the Bangley Coffin idea of form It would be difficult to account
otherwise for what they did For the Pipplys they were very amiable
but as you might say at bay and after reproaching the Bangley Coffins
with having never never never come to see them after promising
solemnly to do so at Cannes where they had all had such a good time
together Mrs Pipply proceeded to say that she didnt know whether we
were drivingif not they had room for one and we might arrange to
meet again somewhere How good of you said Mrs Bangley Coffin and
looked at her two daughters Were really obliged to you said Mr
Bangley Coffin and bent a gaze of strong compulsion upon his wife The
young ladies smiled hesitated and looked at me I couldnt go I had
not even been introduced There was an awkward pausethe kind of pause
you never get out of Englandand as the Pipplys rather huffed and
rather in a hurry were moving off Mrs Bangley Coffin covered their
retreat as it were with the unblushing statement that she was afraid
we must try to keep our little party together And we lost the Pipplys
whereupon Mr Bangley Coffin regarded his family with the air of a
disciplinarian Theyre certain to be on a drag said he and no
end of Pipplys clubs have tents Why didnt one of you go Not classy
enough eh Whereupon they all with one accord began to make excuse
after which we walked on in a troubled silence It was very dusty and
very steep that narrow hill that so many people find fortune at the top
or ruin at the bottom of leading to the heart of Ascot But the day had
brightened and the peopleall going uphillwere disposed to be merry
and two onearmed sailors sat in the sun by the side of the road singing
ballads and shouting Good luck to you ladies so that my spirits
gradually rose I didnt see how I could help enjoying myself

I always think its such a frightful charge for admission to the Grand
Stand said Mrs Bangley Coffin as we walked up the arboreal approach
to it A sovereign Of course they have to do it you know to keep
the mob out but really when one thinks of it it is too much

I thought this a real kindness of Mrs Bangley Coffin because if I had
not known it was so much I might have let Mr Bangley Coffin pay for my
ticket too

It was about this time that Mr Bangley Coffin disappeared He launched
us as it were upon the crowded terrace in front of the Grand Stand
where at every turn the Misses Bangley Coffin expected to see a man they
knew He remained semidetached and clinging for about a quarter of an
hour coming up with an agreeable criticism upon a particular costume
darting off again to talk to a large calm man with an expansive checked
shirtfront and a silk hat well on the back of his head who carried a
notebook Then once Mrs Bangley Coffin addressed him thinking
him behind her Joey love said she Joey love said she again
turning her head But Joey was utterly and wholly gone I believe he
explained afterwards that he had lost us

There said Mrs Bangley Coffin with incisiveness now we must see
somebody we know Pet isnt that Sir Melville Cartus It was and Sir
Melville came up in response to Mrs Bangley Coffins eyeglass and bow
and smile and made himself extremely agreeable for about four minutes
and aquarter Then he also took off his hat with much charm of manner
and went away So did a nervous little Mr Trifugis who joined us for
a short time He said he was on the Fitzwalterss drag and it was so
uncommon full he had apprehensions about getting back Whose drag were
we on and didnt we think it was drawing near the halcyon hour of
luncheon

Nobodys said Mrs Bangley Coffin pointedly We came by train this
year Joey is suffering from a fit of economythe result of Surefoots
behaviour at the Derby It is about time for luncheon

Whereat Mr Trifugis dropped his eyeglass and looked absently over his
left shoulder blushing hard Then he screwed the eyeglass in again very
tight looked at us all with amiable indefiniteness took off his
hat and departed Little beast said Mrs Bangley Coffin candidly
theres not the slightest reason why he couldnt have given us all
luncheon at the Lyric enclosure

Then I began to see why it was so necessary that we should meet somebody
we knewit meant sustenance It was as Mr Trifugis had said quite
time for sustenance and neither the Bangley Coffin family nor I had
had any since breakfast and if it had not been for that consideration
which was naturally a serious one I for my part would have been
delighted just to go round as we seemed likely to do by ourselves
There was no band as there never is in EnglandI suppose because
Edward the Confessor or somebody didnt like bands but there was
everything else that goes to give an occasion brilliance and varietya
mingling crowd of people with conventionally picturesque clothes and
interesting manners sunlight flags a racecourse open boxes an
obvious thrill of excitement a great many novel noises Besides it was
Ascot and its interest was intrinsic

I think we must try the drags said Mrs Bangley Coffinand we
defiled out into the crowd beyond the gates whose dress is not
original that surges unremuneratively between the people who pay on the
coaches and the people who pay on the Lawn It was more amusing outside
though less exclusivelivelier noisier Men were hanging thick against
the palings of the Lawn with expressions of deep sagacity and coloured
shirts calling uninterruptedly Two to one bar one Two to one
Orveito and very well dressed young gentlemen occasionally came up
and entered into respectful conference with them We were jostled a good
deal in the elbowing multitude and it seemed to me to be always as if
in irony by a man who sold gingerbread or boiled lobsters We made our
way through it however and walked slowly in the very shadow of the
drags on top of which people with no better appetites than we had were
ostentatiously feasting We were all to look out for the Pibbly hats
and we didin vain I cant imagine said Mrs Bangley Coffin to
each of her daughters in turn why you didnt go with them We saw Mr
Trifugis and noted bitterly that he had not been at all too late
An actress on the Lyric drag gave us a very frank and fullflavoured
criticism of our dresses but it was unsatisfying except to the
sensibilities

 Shall we try behind mamma asked one of the young ladies Who could possibly see us behind exclaimed Mrs Bangley Coffin who was getting cross Nevertheless we did try behind and somebody did see usseveral very intelligent footmen

Is there no place I inquired for the fourth or fifth time where we
could buy a little light refreshment Mrs Bangley Coffin didnt say
there was not but seemed to think it so improbable that it was hardly
worth our while to look Nobody lunches at Ascot Miss Wick she said
at last with a little asperity except on the drags or at the club
enclosures Itsits impossible

Well I said I think its very unenterprising not to make provision
for such a large number of people If this were in America But just
then we came face to face with Colonel and Mrs B J Silverthorn of
St Pauls Minnesota To say that I was glad to see these old friends
in this particular emergency is to say very little I knew the Colonels
theory of living and I was quite sure that starving for six hours on an
English racecourse had no place in it I knew his generous heart too
and was confident that any daughter of poppas might rely upon it to
the utmost So after introducing Mrs and the Misses Bangley Coffin
I proceeded to explain our unfortunate situation Can you tell us I
begged where we can get something to eat

The Colonel did not hesitate a moment Come right along with me he
said It isnt just the Fifth Avenue Hotel but itll do if youre
hungry and I guess you are And we all followed him to the rather
abridged seclusion of the restaurant behind the Grand Stand The Colonel
did it all very handsomelyordered champagne and more dishes than
twice as many people could have disposed of but the cloud that rested
upon the brows of Mrs and the Misses Bangley Coffin did not disperse
with the comforting influence of food and they kept a nervous eye upon
the comers and goers I suppose they had waited too long for their meal
really to enjoy it

We parted from Colonel and Mrs Silverthorn almost immediately
afterwardsthey said they wanted to go and have another good look
at the Royalties and Dukes in their own yard and Mrs Bangley Coffin
thought it was really our duty to stay where Mr Bangley Coffin might
find us So we went and sat in a row and saw the Gold Cup won and
shortly after took an early train for London Mrs Bangley Coffin
declaring that she had no heart for another sovereign for the Paddock
On the way home she said she was sorry I had had such a dull day and
that it was her first and last attempt to screw Ascot But I had not
had at all a dull dayit had been immensely interesting to say nothing
of the pleasure of meeting Colonel and Mrs Silverthorn I quite agreed
with Mrs Bangley Coffin however that it is better to make liberal
arrangements for Ascot when you go as an Ascot person

I DONT know what we were about to let Miss Wick miss the Boats said
Mr Mafferton one day over his afternoontea in Lady Torquilins flat
I looked at Lady Torquilin and said I thought Mr Mafferton must be
mistaken I had never missed a boat in my life and besides we hadnt
been going anywhere by boat lately The reason we had put off our trip
to Richmond five times was invariably because of the weather Peter
Corke happened to be there that afternoon too though she didnt make
much of a visit Miss Corke never did stay very long when Mr Mafferton
was therehe was a person she couldnt bear She never called him
anything but That She declared you could see hundreds of him any
afternoon in Piccadilly all with the same hat and collar and expression
and carnation in their buttonholes She failed to see why I should
waste any portion of my valuable time in observing Mr Mafferton when
I had still to see Dollys Chop House and Guy the Kingmakers tablet
in Warwick Lane and the Boy in Panyer Alley and was so far unimproved
by anything whatever relating to Oliver Goldsmith or Samuel Johnson
She could not understand that a profoundly uninteresting person might
interest you precisely on that account But Oh you aborigine she
began about the Boats and I presently understood another of those
English descriptive terms by which you mean something that you do not
say

The discussion ended very happily for me in an arrangement suggested
jointly by Miss Corke and Mr Mafferton Lady Torquilin and I should go
to Oxford to see the Eights Mr Mafferton had a nephew at Pembroke
and no doubt the young cub would be delighted to look after us Miss
Corkes younger brother was at Exeter and she would write to the
dear boy at once that he must be nice to us Peter was very sorry she
couldnt come herselfnothing would have given her greater pleasure
she said than to show me all I didnt know in the Bodleian

I suppose we have rather a large exaggerated idea of Oxford in America
thinking about it as it were externally As a name it is so constantly
before us and the terms of respect in which the English despatches
speak of it are so marked that its importance in our eyes has become
extremely great We think it a city of courseno place could grow to
such fame without being a cityand with us the importance of a city
naturally invests itself in large blocks of fine buildings chiefly
devoted to business in a widelyextended and highlyperfected telephone
system and in avenues of Queen Anne residences with the latest modern
conveniences And Lady Torquilin on the way certainly talked a great
deal about the Highwhich she explained to be Oxfords principal
thoroughfareand the purchases she had at one time or another made
on it comparing Oxford with London prices So that I had quite an
extensive State Street or Wabash Avenue idea of the High Both our
young gentlemen friends were fractional parts of the Eights and were
therefore unable to meet us It had been arranged that we should lunch
with one at two and take tea with the other at five but Lady Torquilin
declared herself in urgent need of something sustaining as soon as we
arrived and Shall we go to the Clarendon to get it said she or to
Boffins

What is Boffins I inquired It is not safe in English localisms to
assume that you know anything

Boffins is a pastrycooks Lady Torquilin informed me and I
immediately elected for Boffins It was something idyllic in these
commonplace days when Dickens has been so long dead that Boffin should
be a pastrycook and that a pastrycook should be Boffin Perhaps
it struck me especially because in America he would have been a
confectioner with some aesthetic change in the spelling of the
original Boffin that I am convinced could not be half so good for
business And we walked up a long narrow quiet street bent like an
elbow lined with lowroofed little shops devoted chiefly as I
remember them to the sale of tennisracquets old prints sausages and
gentlemens neckties full of quaint gables and here and there lapsing
into a row of elderly stone houses that had all gone to sleep together
by the pavement leaving their worldly business to the care of the
brassplates on their doors Such a curious old street we went up
to Boffins so peaceful nothing in it but inoffensive boys
pushing handcarts and amiable gentlemen advanced in years with
spectaclescertainly more of these than I ever saw together in any
other placenever drowsing far from the shadow of some serious grey
pile ivybearded and intent like a venerable scholaroh a very
curious old street

Shall we get said I to Lady Torquilin any glimpse of the High
before we reach Boffins Dear Lady Torquilin looked at me sternly
as if to discover some latent insincerity None of your impertinence
miss said she this is the High

I was more charmed and delighted than I can express and as Lady
Torquilin fortunately remembered several things we urgently needed and
could buy to much better advantage in Oxford than in Town I had the
great pleasure of finding out what it was like to shop in the High
and the other queer little streets which are permitted to runno to
creepabout the feet of the great wise old colleges that take such
kindly notice of them It was very nice to my mind that huddling
together of pastrycooks and gargoyles of chapels and old china shops
of battered medival saints and those little modern errandboys
with their handcartsof old times and new preponderatingly old and
respectfully new Much more democratic too than a seat of learning
would be in America where almost every college of reputation is
isolated in the sea of grounds and the only sound that falls upon
the academic ear is the clatter of the lawnmower or the hissing of the
gardenhose Nor shall I soon forget the emotions with which I made
a perfectly inoffensive purchase in a small establishment of wide
reputation for petty wares called apparently from time immemorial
The Civet Catnot reproachfully nor in a spirit of derision but
bearing the name with dignity in painted letters

People who know their way about Oxford will understand how we found ours
to Pembroke from the High I find that I have forgotten We stood at so
many corners to look and Lady Torquilin bade me hurry on so often that
the streets and the colleges and the towers and the gardens are all
lost to me in a crowded memory that diverges with the vagueness of
enchantment from Carfax and Boffins But at last we walked out of the
relative bustle of the highways and byways into the quietest place
I ever saw or felt except a graveyard in the Stranda green square
hedged in with buildings of great dignity and solidity and very serious
mind I felt as we walked around it to ask a respectablelooking man
waiting about on the other side where Mr Sanders Hortons rooms were
as if I were in church

 Yesm This waym if you please said the respectablelooking man MrOrtons rooms is on the first floor hup m and as Mr Horton himself had come out on the landing to receive us and was presently very prettily shaking hands with us we had no further difficulty Our host had not considered himself equal to lunching two strange ladies unassisted however and as he looked a barely possible nineteen this was not remarkable Lady Torquilin thought afterwards He immediately introduced his friend Lord Symonds who seemed if anything less mature but whose manners were quite as nice Then we all sat down in Mr Sanders Hortons pretty little room and watched the final evolution of luncheon on the table and talked about the view You have a lovely lawn said I to Mr Horton who responded that it wasnt a bad quad and when I asked if the respectablelooking man downstairs was the caretaker of the college Oh nothing so swagger said Lord Symonds probably a scout And the presence of a quad and a scout did more than all the guidebooks I read up afterwards to give me a realising sense of being in an English university centre We looked at Mr Hortons pictures too and examined complimentarily all his decorative effects of woodcarving and old china doing our duty as is required of ladies visiting the menage of a young gentleman with enthusiasm I was a little disappointed personally in not finding the initials of Byron or somebody cut on Mr Hortons windowsill and distinctly shocked to hear that this part of Pembroke College had been built within the memory of living man as Mr Horton was reluctantly obliged to admit He apologised for its extreme modernness on the ground of its comparative comfort but seemed to feel it in a subdued way severely as was eminently proper Among the various photographs of boatraces upon the wall was one in which Mr Horton pointed out the Torpids which I could not help considering and remarking upon as a curious name for a boatingcrew Why are they called that I asked they seem to be going pretty fast

Oh rather responded Mr Horton Upon my word I dont know It does
seem hard lines doesnt it Symonds where did these fellows get their
name But Lord Symonds didnt know exactly eithertheyd always
had it he fancied and Lady Torquilin explained that this young
ladymeaning mecould never be satisfied with hearing that a thing
was so because it was soshe must always know the why and wherefore of
everything even when there was neither why nor wherefore at which we
all laughed and sat down to luncheon But I privately made up my mind
to ask an explanation of the Torpids from the first Oxford graduate
with honours that I met and I did He didnt know either He was not a
boatingman however he had taken his honours in Classics

Original HAD heard so much from English sources of the precocity and forwardness of very young people in America that I was quite prepared to find a commendably opposite state of things in England and I must say that generally speaking I was not disappointed The extent to which young ladies and gentlemen under twentytwo can sit up straight and refrain from conversation here impressed me as much as anything I have seen in society I have not observed any of this shyness in married ladies or older gentlemen and that struck me oddly too for in America it is only with advancing years that we become conscious of our manners

I have no doubt that if the Eights had been in Americawhere they
would probably be called the Octopletsand Mr Sanders Horton had been
a Harvard Sophomore and Lord Symondss father had made his fortune out
of a patent shoelacetag and we had all been enjoying ourselves over
there we might have noticed a difference both in the appearance and the
behaviour of these young gentlemen They would certainly have been older
for their years and more elaborately dressed Their complexions would
probably not have been so fresh nor their shoulders so broad and the
pencilling on Mr Hortons upper lip and the delicate fair marking on
Lord Symondss would assuredly have deepened into a moustache Their
manners would not have been so negatively good as they were in Oxford
where they struck me as expressing an ideal above all things to avoid
doing those things which they ought not to do Their politeness would
have been more effusive and not the least bit nervous though I hope
neither Mr Horton nor Lord Symonds will mind my implying that in Oxford
they were nervous People cant possibly help the way they have been
brought up and to me our hosts nervousness was interesting like his
English accent and the scout and the quad Personally I liked the
feeling of superinducing bashfulness in two nice boys like thoseit was
novel and amusingthough I have no doubt they were much more afraid of
Lady Torquilin than of me I never saw a boy however from twelve to
twentythreewhich strikes me as the span of boyhood in Englandthat
was not Lady Torquilins attached slave after twenty minutes
conversation with her She did not humour them or flatter them or talk
to them upon their particular subjects she was simply what they called
jolly to them and their appreciation was always prompt and lively
Lady Torquilin got on splendidly with both Mr Sanders Horton and Lord
Symonds The only reason why Mr Hortons lunch was not an unqualifiedly
brilliant success was that whenever she talked to one of our hosts the
other one was left for me to talk to which was usually distressing for
both of us

It was an extremely nice lunch served with anxious deference by the
respectablelooking little man who had come upstairs and nervously
commanded by Mr Horton at one end with the cold joint and Lord Symonds
at the other with the fowl It began I remember with bouillon Lady
Torquilin partook of bouillon so did I but the respectable scout did
not even offer it to the young gentlemen I caught a rapid inquiring
glance from Lady Torquilin Could it be that there was not bouillon
enough The thought checked any utterance upon the subject and we
finished our soup with careful indifference while Lord Symonds covered
the awkwardness of the situation by explaining to me demonstratively
the nature of a Bump I did not understand Bumps then nor did I succeed
during the course of the afternoon in picking up enough information to
write intelligently about them But this was because Lord Symonds had
no bouillon Under the circumstances it was impossible for me to put my
mind to it

Presently Mr Horton asked us if he might give us some salmonnot
collectively but individually and properly Lady Torquillin first and
we said he might He did not help Lord Symonds and relapsed himself
as it were into an empty plate It was Lady Torquilins business to
inquire if the young gentlemen were not well or if salmon did not agree
with them and not mine but while I privately agitated this matter I
unobservantly helped myself to mayonnaise II beg your pardon said
Mr Sanders Horton in a pink agony thats cream So it was waiting
in a beautiful oldfashioned silver pitcher the advent of those idylls
that come after It was a critical moment Only one thing occurred to me
to say for which I hope I may be forgiven

Original Yes I returned we like it with fish in America At which Mr Horton looked interested and relieved And I ate as much of the mixture as I could with a smile though the salmon had undergone a vinegar treatment which made this difficult It is in Boston is it not remarked Lord Symonds politely that the people live almost entirely upon beans And the conversation flowed quite generally until the advent of the fowl It was a large wellconditioned chicken and when the young gentlemen apparently by mutual consent refrained from partaking of it the situation had reached a degree of unreasonableness which was more than Lady Torquilin could endure

Do you intend to eat

Oh wed like to but we cant they replied earnestly and
simultaneously

Were still in training you know Lord Symonds went on Fellows have
got to train pretty much on stodge And at this juncture Mr Horton
solemnly cut two slices of the cold beef and sent them to his friend
helping himself to the same quantity with mathematical exactness Then
with plain bread and gravity which might almost be called severe they
attacked it

Lady Torquilin and I looked at each other reproachfully This privation
struck us as needless and extreme and it had the uncomfortable moral
effect of turning our own repast into a Bacchanalian revel We frowned
we protested we besought We suggested with insidious temptation that
this was the last day of the races and that nobody would know We
commended each particular dish in turn in terms we thought most
appetising It was very wrong and it had the sting which drives
wrongdoing most forcibly home to the conscience of being entirely
futile besides engendering the severe glances of the respectable scout
The young gentlemen were as adamant if adamant could blush They
would not be moved and at every fresh appeal they concentrated their
attention upon their cold beef in a manner which I thought most noble
if a trifle ferocious At last they began to look a little stern
and disapproving and we stopped conscious of having trenched
disrespectfully upon an ideal of conduct But over the final delicacy
of Mr Hortons lunch the first of the season Lady Torquilin regarded
them wistfully Not even gooseberry tart said she And I will not say
that there was no regret in the courageous rejoinder

Not even gooseberry tart

I am not pretending to write about the things that ought to have
impressed me most but the things that did impress me most and these
were at Mr Sanders Hortons luncheon the splendid old silver college
goblets into which our host poured us lavish bumpers of claretcup the
moral support of the respectable scout and the character and dignity
an ideal of duty may possess even in connection with cold beef I came
into severe contact with an idiom too which I shall always associate
with that occasion Lord Symonds did not belong to Pembroke College
and I asked him after we had exchanged quite a good deal of polite
conversation which one he did belong to

How lovely these old colleges are I remarked and so nice and
impressive and timestained Which one do you attend Lord Symonds

Maudlin said Lord Symonds apparently taking no notice of my
question and objecting to the preceding sentiment

Do you think so I said I was not offended I had made up my mind
some time before never to be offended in England until I understood
things Im very sorry but they do strike an American that way you
know

Lord Symonds did not seem to grasp my meaning It is jolly old said
he Not so old as some of em New for instance But I thought you
asked my college Maudlin just this side of Maudlin bridge you know

Oh I said And will you be kind enough to spell your college Lord
Symonds I am but a simple American over here partly for the purpose of
improving my mind

Certainly Magdalen returned Lord Symonds very
goodnaturedly Now that you speak of it it is rather a rum way of
spelling it Something like Cholmondeley Now how would you spell
Cholmondeley

I was glad to have his attention diverted from my mistake but
the reputation of Cholmondeley is worldwide and I spelled it
triumphantly I should like to confront an American spellingmatch
with Magdalen though and about eleven other valuable orthographical
specimens that I am taking care of

In due course we all started for the river finding our way through
quads even greyer and greener and quieter than Exeter and finally
turning into a pretty wide treebordered highway much too well
trodden to be a popular Lovers Walk but dustily pleasant and shaded
withal We were almost an hour too early for the races as Mr Horton
and Lord Symonds wished to take us on the river before they were obliged
to join their respective crews and met hardly anybody except occasional
strolling loosegarmented undergraduates with very various ribbons on
their round straw hats which they took off with a kind of spasmodic
gravity when they happened to know our friends The treebordered walk
ended more or less abruptly at a small stream bordered on its hither
side by a series of curious constructions reminding one of all sorts
of things from a Greek warship to a Methodist church in Dakota and
wonderfully painted These Mr Horton explained were the College
barges from which the race was viewed and he led the way to the Exeter
barge There is a stairway to these barges leading to the top and Mr
Horton showed us up to wait until he and Lord Symonds got out the punt

The word punting was familiar to me signifying an aquatic pursuit
popular in England but I had never even seen a punt and was very
curious about it I cannot say however that the English punt when our
friends brought it round struck me as a beautiful object Doubtless it
had points of excellence even of grace as compared with other puntsI
do not wish to disparage itbut I suffered from the lack of a standard
to admire it by It seemed to me an uninteresting vessel and I did not
like the way it was cut off at the ends The mode of propulsion too
by which Mr Horton and Lord Symonds got us around the riverpoking a
stick into the mud at the bottom and leaning on itdid not impress me
as being dignified enough for anybody in Society Lord Symonds asked me
as we sat in one end enjoying the sunyou get to like it in England
even on the back of your neckwhat I thought of punting I told him I
thought it was immoderately safe It was the most polite thing I could
think of at the spur of the moment I do not believe punting would ever
become popular in America We are a lightminded people we like an
element of joyous risk we are not adapted to punt

The people were beginning to come down upon the barges when we returned
from this excursion and it was thought best that we should take our
places The stream was growing very full not only of laborious punts
containing three brightlydressed ladies and one perspiring young man
but of all kinds of craft some luxuriously overshadowed with flounced
awnings under which young gentlemen with cigaretteattachments reposed
protecting themselves further with Japanese paper umbrellas The odd
part of this was that both they and their umbrellas seemed to be taken
by themselves and everybody else quite au srieux This again would be
different in America

Mr Horton left us with Lord Symonds who had not to row he explained
to us until later in the day and presently we saw our host below with
the rest of his barelegged muscular crew getting gingerly into the
long narrow outrigger lying alongside They arranged themselves with
great care and precision and then held their oars looking earnestly at
a little man who sat up very straight in the sternthe cox He was my
first cox for I had never seen a boatrace before excepting between
champions who do not row with coxes and I was delighted to find how
accurately he had been described in the articles we read about English
boatinghis size his erectness and alertness and autocratic dignity
At a word from the cox every man turned his head halfway round and
back again then he said in the sternest accents I had ever heard
Areyouready and in an instant they were off

Where are they going Lady Torquilin asked

Oh for a preliminary spin said Lord Symonds and then for the
startingpoint

And when do the barges start I inquired without having given the
matter any kind of consideration

The barges said Lord Symonds mystified Do you mean these They
dont start they stay here

But can we see the race from here I asked

Beautifully They come past

Do I understand Lord Symonds that the Oxford boatrace takes place
out there

Certainly said he Why not

Oh no particular reason I returnedif there is room

Rather the young gentleman explained This is the noble river Isis
Miss Wick

It may not be so big as the Mississippi but its worthy of your
respectful consideration young lady put in Lady Torquilin Thus
admonished I endeavoured to give the noble river Isis my respectful
consideration but the barges occupied so much space in it that I was
still unable to understand how a boatrace of any importance could
come between us and the opposite bank without seriously inconveniencing
somebody

It did however and such was the skill displayed by the coxes in
charge that nobody was hurt It came off amid demonstrations of the most
extraordinary nature tin whistles predominating on the opposite bank
where I saw a genuine bishop capering along with the crowd waving his
hat on his stick It came off straight and tense and arrowy cheered to
the last stroke

 So near it said Lord Symonds after shouting Well rowed Pembroke until he could shout no longer

Near what I asked

A bump said he sadly but it was jolly well rowed and for the
moment I felt that no earthly achievement could compare with the making
of bumps

Such excitement I never saw among the Dons on the bargesmy first
Dons too but they differed very much I could not generalise about
themamong their wives who seemed unaggressive youngish ladies as
a rule in rather subdued gowns among the gay people down from Town
among the college men incorrigibly uproarious among that considerable
body of society that adds so little to the brilliance of such an
occasion but contributes so largely to its noise And after it was over
a number of exuberant young men on the other side plunged into the noble
river Isis and crossed it with a few wellplaced strides and possibly
two strokes None of them were drowned

After that we had a joyous halfhour in the apartments at Exeter of
Mr Bertie Corke whose brown eyes had Peters very twinkle in them and
who became established in our affections at once upon that account Mr
Corke was one of the Exeter Eight and he looked reproachfully at
us when we inadvertently stated that we had lingered to congratulate
Pembroke

Pembroke got a bump you know yesterday I remarked proud of the
technicality

Yes returned Mr Bertie Corke ruefully bumped us

This was an unfortunate beginning but it did not mar our subsequent
relations with Miss Peter Corkes brother which were of the pleasantest
description He told us on the way down once more to the noble river
Isis the names of all those delightful elderly stone images that had
themselves put over the college doors centuries ago when they were
built and he got almost as many interiors into half an hour as
his sister could He explained to us too how by the rules of the
University he was not allowed to play marbles on the college steps
or to wear clothes of other than an obfusc hue which was exactly the
kind of thing that Peter would tell youand expect you to remember He
informed us too that according to the pure usage of Oxonian English he
was a Fresher the man we had just passed being an unattached student
a tosher probably walking for what in the vulgar tongue might be
called exercise but here was ekker In many ways he was like Peter
and he objected just as much to my abuse of the English climate

The second race was very like the first with more enthusiasm I have a
little folding card with The Eights May  to   and the names
of the colleges in the order of starting printed in blue letters on the
inside The order of finish from B N C to St Edm Hall is in
Mr Bertie Corkes handwriting Im not a sentimentalist but I liked
the Eights and I mean to keep this souvenir

Original HE records of my experiences in London would be very incomplete without another chapter devoted to those Miss Peter Corke arranged for me Indeed I would need the license of many chapters to explain at any length how generously Miss Corke fulfilled to me the offices of guide philosopher and friend how she rounded out my days with counsel and was in all of them a personal blessing

Dispensing information was a habit which Peter Corke incorrigibly
establishedone of the things she could not help I believe an
important reason why she liked me was because I gave her such unlimited
opportunities for indulging it and she said I simulated gratitude
fairly well For my own part I always liked it whether it was at the
expense of my accent or my idioms my manners or my morals my social
theories or my general education and encouraged her in it I was
pleased with the idea that she found me interesting enough to make it
worth while for one thing and then it helped my understanding of the
lady herself better than anything else would have done And many voyages
and large expense might go into the balance against an acquaintance with
Peter Corke

Miss Corke was more ardently attached to the Past than anybody I have
ever known or heard of that did not live in it Her interest did not
demand any great degree of antiquity though it increased in direct
ratio with the centuries the mere fact that a thing was over and done
with laid on the shelf or getting mossy and forgotten was enough to
secure her respectful consideration She liked old folios and printsit
was her pastime to poke in the dust of ages Ive seen her placidly
enjoying a graveyardwith no recent intermentsfor half an hour at a
time She had a fine scorn of the Present in all its forms and phases
If I heard her speak with appreciation of anybody with whose reputation
I was unacquainted I generally found it safe to ask intelligently
When did he die She always knew exactly and who attended the
funeral and what became of the children and whether the widow got an
annuity from the Government or not being usually of the opinion that
the widow should have had the annuity

Of course it was Miss Corke who took me down into Fleet Street to see
where Dr Johnson used to live I did not hear the name of Dr Johnson
from another soul in London during the whole of my visit My friend bore
down through the Strand and past that medival griffin where Temple
Bar was that claws the air in protection of your placid Prince in a
frockcoat underneathstopping here an instant for anathemaand on
into the crook of Fleet Street under St Pauls with all the pure
delight of an enthusiastic cicerone in her face I think Peter loved
the Strand and Fleet Street almost as well as Dr Johnson did and
she always wore direct descendants of the sevenleague boots This was
sometimes a little trying for mine which had no pedigree though
in other respects but I must not be led into the statement that
shoemaking is not scientifically apprehended in this country I have
never yet been able to get anybody to believe it

This said Miss Corke as we emerged from a dark little alley occupied
by two unmuzzled small boys and a dog into a dingy rectangle where the
London light came down upon unblinking rows of windows in walls of all
colours that get the worse for wearthis is Gough Court Dr Johnson
lived here until the death of his wife You remember that he had a wife
and she died

I have not the least doubt of it I replied

Ive no patience with you cried Miss Corke fervently Well when
she died he was that disconsolate in spite of his dictionaries that he
couldnt bear it here any longer and moved away

I dont think that was remarkable I said looking round to which
Miss Corke replied that it was a fine place in those days and Johnson
paid so many pounds shillings and pence rent for it every Lady Day
I am waiting she said with ironical resignation for you to ask me
which house

Oh said I Which house

That yellowish one at the end idjit said Peter with exasperation
Now if you please well go

I took one long and thoughtful look at the yellowish house at the end
and tried to imagine the compilation of lexicons inside its walls about
the year  and turned away feeling that I had done all within my
personal ability for the memory of Dr Johnson Miss Corke however was
not of that opinion He moved to Johnsons Court somewhat later she
said which you must be careful to remember was not named from him
Well just go there now

Is it far I asked because there must be other celebrities

Far repeated Miss Corke with a withering accent not ten minutes
walk Do the trams run everywhere in America There may be other
celebritiesLondon is a good place for thembut theres only one
Samuel Johnson

We went through various crooked ways to Johnsons Court Miss Corke
explaining and reviling at every step We hear she remarked with fine
scorn of intelligent Americans who come over here and apply themselves
diligently to learn London And Ive never met a citizen of you yet
she went on ignoring my threatening parasol that was not quite
satisfied at seeing one of Johnsons houseshouses he lived in You are
a nation of tasters Miss Mamie Wick of Chicago At which I declared
myself for the honour of the Stars and Stripes willing to swallow any
quantity of Dr Johnson and we turned into a little paved parallelogram
seven times more desolate than the first Its prevailing idea was soot
relieved by scraps of blackened ivy that twisted along some of the
windowsills I once noticed very clever ivy decorations in iron upon a
London balcony and always afterwards found some difficulty in deciding
between that and the natural vine unless the wind blew And I would not
like to commit myself about the ivy that grew in Johnson s Court Dear
me said I so he lived here too I do not transcribe this remark
because it struck me as particularly clever but because it seems to
me to be the kind of thing anybody might have said without exciting
indignation But Peter immediately began to fulminate again Yes she
said he lived here too miss at No  as you dont appear to care
to know A little intelligent curiosity she continued apparently
appealing to the Samuel Johnson chimneys would be gratifying

We walked around these precincts several times while Miss Corke told me
interesting stories that reminded me of Colliers English Literature
at school and asked me if by any chance I had ever heard of Boswell
I loved to find myself knowing something occasionally just to annoy
Peter and when I said certainly he was the man to whom Dr Johnson
owed his reputation it had quite the usual effect

We shall now go to Bolt Court said my friend where Samuel spent the
last of his days surrounded by a lot of old ladies that I dont see how
he ever put up with and from which he was carried to Westminster Abbey
in  Hadnt you better put that down

Now Peter Corke would never have permitted me to call Dr Johnson
Samuel

I looked round Johnsons Court with lingering affection and hung back
There is something about this place I said some occult attraction
that makes me hate to leave it I believe Peter that the Past under
your influence is beginning to affect me properly I dislike the
thought of remaining for any length of time out of reach as it were of
the memory of Dr Johnson

Peter looked at me suspiciously He lived at Bolt Court as well she
said

Nowhere between here and there I asked No friends house for
instance where he often spent the night Where did that lady live who
used to give him nineteen cups of tea at a sitting Couldnt we pause
and refresh ourselves by looking at her portals on the way

Transatlantic impertinence cried Miss Corke leading the way out is
more than I can bear

But I said still hanging back about how far

When my dear friend gave vent to the little squeal with which she
received this I knew that her feelings were worked up to a point where
it was dangerous to tamper with them so I submitted to Bolt Court
walking with humility all the way When we finally arrived I could see
no intrinsic difference between this court and the others except that
rather morerecentlycurrent literature had blown up from an adjacent
newsstall For a person who changed his residence so often Dr
Johnsons domestic tastes must have undergone singularly little
alteration

He went from here to Westminster Abbey I think you said I remarked
respectfully to Peter

In  said Peter who is a stickler for dates

And has not moved since I added with some anxiety just to aggravate
Peter who was duly aggravated

Well I responded we saw Westminster Abbey you remember And I took
particular notice of the monument to Dr Johnson We neednt go there

Its in St Pauls said Peter in a manner which wounded me for if
there is an unpleasant thing it is to be disbelieved

And which house did Dr Johnson live in here I inquired

Come said Peter solemnly and Ill show you

It has been lost to posterity she continued with depressionburnt
in  But we have the sitethere

Oh I replied We have the site That isthat is something I
suppose But I dont find it very stimulating to the imagination

You havent any remarked Miss Corke with vehemence and I have no
doubt she had reason to think so As a matter of fact however the name
of Samuel Johnson is not a household word in Chicago We dont govern
our letterwriting by his Dictionary and as to the Tatler and the
Rambler it is impossible for people living in the United States to
read up the back numbers of even their own magazines It is true that we
have no excuse for not knowing Rasselas but Ive noticed that at
home hardly any of the English classics have much chance against Rider
Haggard and now that Rudyard Kipling has arisen it will be worse still
for elderly respectable authors like Dr Johnson So that while I was
deeply interested to know that the great lexicographer had hallowed such
a considerable part of London with his residence I must confess to be
candid that I would have been satisfied with fewer of his architectural
remains I could have done for instance without the site though I
dare say as Peter says they were all good for me

Before I reached Lady Torquilins flat again that day Peter showed me
the particular window in Wine Office Court where dear little Goldsmith
sat deploring the bailiff and the landlady when Dr Johnson took the
Vicar away and sold it for sixty poundsthat delightful old fairy
godfather whom everybody knows so much better than as the author of
Rasselas And the Cheshire Cheese on the other side of the way
that quaintest of lowwindowed taverns where the two sat with their
friends over the famous pudding that is still served on the same day of
the week Here I longed in especial to go inside and inquire about the
pudding and when we might come down and have some but Peter said it
was not proper for ladies and hurried me on As if any impropriety
could linger about a place a hundred and fifty years old

The Temple also we saw that day and Goldsmiths quiet solitary grave
in the shadow of the old Knights Church more interesting and lovable
there somehow than it would be in the crowd at Westminster Miss
Peter Corke was entirely delightful in the Temple whether she talked
of Goldsmiths games and dancing over Blackstones sedate head in Brick
Court or of Elizabeth sitting on the wide platform at the end of the
Middle Temple Hall at the first performance of Twelfth Night where
somewhere beneath those dusky oak rafters Shakespeare made another
critic Peter never talked scandal in the present tense on principle
but a more interesting gossip than she was of a century back I never had
a cup of tea with which we got not so very far from the Cock Tavern in
Fleet Street and I had never known before that Mr Pepys was a flirt

Original R MAFFERTON frequently expressed his regret that almost immediately after my arrival in Londonin fact during the time of my disappearance from the Mtropole and just as he became aware of my being with Lady Torquilinhis mother and two sisters bad been obliged to go to the Riviera on account of one of the Misses Maffertons health One afternoonthe day before they left I believeLady Torquilin and I coming in found a large assortment of cards belonging to the family which were to be divided between us apparently But as Mr Charles Mafferton was the only one of them left in town my acquaintance with the Maffertons had made very little progress except of course with the portly old cousin I have mentioned before who was a lord and who stayed in London through the entire session of Parliament This cousin and I became so well acquainted in spite of his being a lord that we used to ask each other conundrums What do they call a black cat in London was a favourite one of his But I had the advantage of Lord Mafferton here for he always forgot that he had asked the same conundrum the last time we met and thought me tremendously clever when I answered Puss puss But as I have said before there were very few particulars in which this nobleman gratified my inherited idea of what a lord ought to be

One of the Misses Maffertonthe one who enjoyed good healthhad very
kindly taken the trouble to write to me from the Riviera a nice friendly
letter saying how sorry they all were that we did not meet before they
left Town and asking me to make them a visit as soon as they returned
in June The letter went on to say that they had shared their brothers
anxiety about me for some time but felt quite comfortable in the
thought of leaving me so happily situated with Lady Torquilin an old
friend of their own and was it not singular Miss Mafferton exclaimed
in her pointed handwriting signing herself mine ever affectionately E
F Mafferton I thought it was certainly singularly nice of her to write
to me like that a perfect stranger and while I composed an answer in
the most cordial terms I could I thought of all I had heard about the
hearty hospitality of the Englishwhen once you know them

When I told Mr Mafferton I had heard from his sister and how much
pleasure the letter had given me he blushed in the most violent and
unaccountable manner but seemed pleased nevertheless It was odd to
see Mr Mafferton discomposed and it discomposed me I could not in the
least understand why his sisters politeness to a friend of his should
embarrass Mr Mafferton and was glad when he said he had no doubt
Eleanor and I would be great friends and changed the subject But
it was about this time that another invitation from relatives of Mr
Maffertons living in Berkshire gave me my one alwaystoberemembered
experience of the country in England Lady Torquilin was invited too
but the invitation was for a Tuesday and Wednesday particularly full of
engagements for her

Couldnt we write and say wed rather come next week I suggested

Lady Torquilin looked severely horrified I should think not she
replied Youre not in America child I hardly know these people at
all moreover its you they want to see and not me in the least So
Ill just send my apologies and tell Mrs Stacy youre an ablebodied
young woman who gets about wonderfully by herself and that she may
expect you by the train she proposesand see that you dont outstay
your invitation young lady or I shall be in a fidget And Lady
Torquilin gave me her cheek to kiss and went away and wrote to Mrs
Stacy as she had said

An hour or two beyond London the parallel tracks of the main line
stretched away in the wrong direction for me and my train sped down
them leaving me for a few minutes undecided how to proceed The little
station seemed to have nothing whatever to do with anything but the main
line It sat there in the sun and cultivated its flowerbeds and waited
for the big trains to come thundering by and had no concern but that
Presently however I observed standing all by itself beside a row
of tulips under a clay bank on the other side of the bridge the most
diminutive thing in railway transport I had ever seen It was quite
complete engine and cab and luggagevan and all with its passenger
accommodation properly divided into first second and third class and
it stood there placidly apparently waiting for somebody And I followed
my luggage over the bridge with the quiet conviction that this was the
train for Pinbury and that it was waiting for me

There was nobody else And after the porter had stowed my effects
carefully away in the van he also departed leaving the Pinbury train in
my charge I sat in it for a while and admired the tulips and wondered
how soon it would rain and fixed my veil and looked over the Daily
Graphic again but nothing happened It occurred to me that possibly
the little Pinbury train had been forgotten and I got out There was
no one on the platform but just outside the station I saw a rusty old
coachman seated on the box of an open landau so I spoke to him Does
that train go to PinburyI asked He said it did Does it go today
I inquired further He looked amused at my ignorance Oh yes lady
he replied she goes every daytwice But she as to wait for two
hup trains yet Shell be hoff in about alf an hour nowthis
reassuringly

When we did start it took us exactly six minutes to get to Pinbury and
I was sorry I had not tipped the enginedriver and got him to run down
with me and back again while he was waiting Whatever they may say to
the contrary there are few things in England that please Americans more
than the omnipotence of the tip

Two of the Stacy young ladies met me on the Pinbury platform and gave
me quite the most charming welcome I have had in England With the
exception of Peter Corkeand Peter would be exceptional anywhereI had
nearly always failed to reach any sympathetic relation with the young
ladies I had come in contact with in London Perhaps this was because
I did not see any of them very often or very long together and seldom
without the presence of some middleaged lady who controlled the
conversation but the occasions of my meeting with the London girl had
never sufficed to overcome the natural curiosity with which she usually
regarded me I rejoiced when I saw that it would be different with Miss
Stacy and Miss Dorothy Stacy and probably with the other Misses Stacy
at home They regarded me with outspoken interest but not at all
with fear They were very polite but their politeness was of the
gay unconscious sort which only impresses you when you think of it
afterwards Delightfully pretty though lacking that supreme inertia of
expression that struck me so often as the finishing touch upon London
beauty and gracefully tall without that impressiveness of development
I had observed in town Miss Dorothy Stacys personality gave me quite a
new pleasure It was invested in round pink cheeks and clear grey eyes
among other things that made it most agreeable to look at her and
yellow hair that went rippling down her back and the perfect freshness
and unconsciousness of her beauty with her height and her gentle
muscularity reminded one of an immature goddess of Olympia if such
a person could be imagined growing up Miss Dorothy Stacy was sixteen
past and in a later moment of confidence she told me that she lived in
dread of being obliged to turn up her hair and wear irretrievably long
frocks I found this unreasonable but charming In America all joys
are grown up and the brief period of pinafores is one of probation

We drove away in a little brown dogcart behind a little brown pony into
the English country talking a great deal Miss Stacy drove and I sat
beside her while Miss Dorothy Stacy occupied the seat in the rear when
she was not alighting in the middle of the road to pick up the Pinbury
commissions which did not travel well or the ponys foot to see if he
had a stone in it The pony objected with mild viciousness to having his
foot picked up but Miss Dorothy did not take his views into account at
all up came the foot and out came the stone The average American girl
would have driven helplessly along until she overtook a man I think

I never saw a finer quality of mercy anywhere than the Stacy young
ladies exhibited toward their beast When we came to a rising bit of
road Miss Dorothy invariably leaped down and walked as well as the pony
to save him fatigue when a slight declivity presented itself he walked
again solemnly to the bottom occasionally being led He expected this
attention always at such times pausing at the top and looking round for
it and when it was withheld his hindquarters assumed an aggrieved
air of irresponsibility When Miss Stacy wished to increase his rate of
going by a decimal point she flicked him gently selecting a spot where
communication might be made with his brain at least inconvenience to
himself but she never did anything that would really interfere with his
enjoyment of the drive

Of course Miss Stacy wanted to know what I thought of England in a
large general way but before I had time to do more than mention a few
heads under which I had gathered my impressions she particularised with
reference to the scenery Miss Stacy asked me what I thought of English
scenery with a sweet and ladylike confidence including most of what we
were driving through with a graceful flourish of her whip She said
I might as well confess that we hadnt such nice scenery in America
Grander you knowmore mountains and lakes and things said
Miss Stacy but not really so nice now have you No I said
unfortunately it was about the only thing we couldnt manage to take
back with us at which Miss Stacy astonished me with the fact that she
knew I was going to be a treat to herso originaland I must be simply
craving my tea and it was good of me to come and flicked the pony
severely so that he trotted for almost half a mile without a pause

But we returned to the scenery for I did not wish to be thought
unappreciative and the Misses Stacy were good enough to be interested
in the points that I found particularly novel and pleasingthe
flowering hedges that leaned up against the fields by the wayside and
the quantities of little birds that chirruped in and out of them and
the trees all twisted round with ivy and especially the rabbits that
bobbed about in the meadows and turned up their little white tails with
as much naivete as if the world were a kitchengarden closed to the
public The bunnies as Miss Dorothy Stacy called them were a source
of continual delight to me I could never refrain from exclaiming
Theres another much to the young ladies amusement You see
explained Miss Dorothy in apology theyre not new to us the dear
sweet things One might say one has been brought up with them one knows
all their little ways But they are loves and it is nice of you to like
them

The pony stopped altogether on one little rise as if he were accustomed
to it to allow us to take a sidelook across the greygreen fields to
where they lost themselves in the blue distance in an effort to climb
It was a lovely landscape full of pleasant thoughts ideally still and
gently conscious There was the glint of a river in it white in the
sun with twisting lines of roundheaded willows marking which way it
went and other trees in groups and rows threw soft shadows across the
contented fields These trees never blocked the view one could always
see over and beyond them into other peaceful stretches with other
clumps and lines greyer and smaller as they neared the line where the
low blue sky thickened softly into clouds and came closer down An
occasional spire here and there a farmhouse queer oldfashioned
hayricks gossiping in the corners of the fields cows horses crows
All as if it had been painted by a tenderly conscientious artist who
economised his carmines and allowed himself no caprices except in the
tattered hedge full of May in the foreground all as if Naturehad
understood a womans chief duty to be tidy and delectable except for
this ragged hem of her embroidered petticoat I dare say it would not
seem so to you but the country as I had known it in America had been
an expanse of glowing colour diversified by a striking pattern of
snakefences relieved by woods that nobody had ever planted and
adorned by the bare commanding brick residences of the agricultural
population Consequently delightful as I found this glimpse of English
scenery I could not combat the idea that it had all been carefully
and beautifully made and was usually kept under cottonwool You would
understand this if you knew the important part played in our rural
districts by the American stump

Isnt it lovely asked Miss Stacy with enthusiasm Two cows in the
middle distance suddenly disappeared behind a hayrick and for a moment
the values of the landscape became confused Still I was able to say
that it was lovely and so neatwhich opinion I was obliged to
explain to Miss Stacy as I have to you while the brown pony took us
thoughtfully on

Original DROVE in at the gates of Hallington House as one might drive into the scene of a dear old dreama dream that one has halfbelieved and halfdoubted and wholly loved and dreamed again all ones life long There it stood as I had always wondered if I might not see it standing in that far day when I should go to England behind its high brick wall in the midst of its ivies and laburnums and elms and laurelbushes looking across where its lawns dipped into its river at soft green meadows sloping to the westa plain old solid grey stone English countryhouse so long occupied with the birthdays of other people that it had quite forgotten its own Very big and very solid without any pretentiousness of Mansard roof or bow window or balcony or verandah its simple story of strength and shelter and home and hospitality was plain to me between its wideopen gates and its wideopen doors and I loved it from that moment

It was the same all throughthe Stacys realised the England of my
imagination to me most sweetly and completely I found that there had
been no mistake Mrs Stacy realised it pretty and fresh and fair
at fifty plump and motherly in her black cashmere and lace full of
pleasant greetings and responsible inquiries So did the Squire coming
out of his study to ask with courteous oldfashioned solicitude how I
had borne the fatigue of the journeysuch a delightful old Squire left
over by accident from the last century with his highbred phraseology
and simple dignity and great friendliness So did the rest of the
Stacy daughters clustering round their parents and their guest and the
teapot talking gaily with their rounded English accent of all manner
of thingsthe South Kensington Museum the Pinbury commissions the
prospects for tennis Presently I found myself taken through just such
narrow corridors and down just such unexpected steps as I would have
hoped for to my room and left there I remember how a soft wind
came puffing in at the little low tinypaned window flung back on
its hinges swelling out the muslin curtains and bringing with it the
sweetest sound I heard in Englanda cry that was quite new and strange
and yet came into me from the quiet hedges of the nestling
world outside as I sat there bewitched by it with a plaintive
familiarityCuckoo Cuckoo I must have heard it and loved
it years ago when the Wicks lived in England through the ears of my
ancestors Then I discovered that the room was full of a dainty scent
that I had not known before and traced it to multitudinous little round
flowerbunches palest yellow and palest green that stood about in
everything that would hold themfresh and pure and delicious all the
tender soul of the spring in them all the fairness of the meadows and
the love of the shy English sun Ah the charm of it It is almost worth
while being brought up in Chicago to come fresh to cuckoos and cowslips
and learn their sweet meaning when you are grown up and can understand
it I mean of course entirely apart from the inestimable advantages of
a Republican form of Government female emancipation and the climate of
Illinois We have no cowslips in Chicago and no cuckoos and the
cable cars do not seem altogether to make up for them I couldnt help
wishing as I leaned through my low little window into the fragrant
peace outside that Nature had taken a little more time with America

Cuckoo from the hedge again I could not go till the answer came from
the toppling elmboughs in the field corner Cuckoo And in another
minute if I listened I should hear it again

Down below in the meantime out came two tidy little maids in cap
and apron and began to weed and to potter about two tidy little
plotstheir own little gardens anybody might know by the solicitude
and the comparisons they indulged inthe freedom too with which they
pulled what pleased themselves It was pretty to see the little maids
and I fell to conjecturing such a scene in connection with the domestic
duchess of Chicago but without success Her local interest could never
be sufficiently depended upon for one thing Marguerite might plant
and Irene might water but Arabella Maud would certainly gather the
fruits of their labour if she kept her place long enough And I doubt
if the social duties of any of these ladies would leave them time for
such idylls

Cuckoo The bird caught it from the piping of the very first lovers
very first lovedream How well he must have listened Cuckoo

I bade Miss Dorothy Stacy come in when I heard her knock and voice and
she seemed to bring with her in her innocent strength and youth and
pinkness a very fair and harmonious counterpart of the cowslips and the
cuckoos She came to know if I wasnt coming down to tea Listen I
said as the sweet cry came again I was waiting till he had finished
It was better than no excuse at all

I think I can show you from here where I suspect they have stolen a
nest lazy things answered Miss Dorothy sympathetically and she
slipped her arm round my waist as we looked out of the window together
in the suspected direction Then you dont find them tiresome Some
people do you know No I said I dont And then Miss Dorothy
confided to me that she was very glad for you know she said I one
cant like people who find cuckoos tiresome and we concluded that we
really must go down to tea At that point however I was obliged to
ask Miss Dorothy to wait until I did a little towards improving my
appearance I had quite forgotten between the cuckoos and the cowslips
that I had come up principally to wash my face

You met our cousin on the ship crossing the Atlantic didnt you
the third Miss Stacy remarked enthusiastically over the teapot How
delightfully romantic to make aa frienda friend like that I mean
on a ship in the middle of the ocean Didnt you always feel perfectly
comfortable afterwards as if no matter what happened he would be sure
to save you

Kitty said Mrs Stacy from the sofa in a tone of helpless rebuke
Mother darling said Kitty I do beg your pardon Your daughter
always speaks first and thinks afterwards doesnt she sweetest mother
But you must have had that feeling Miss Stacy continued to me I know
you had

Oh no I returned It was rather an awkward situation

I had no wish to disparage Miss Stacys cousins heroism which
nevertheless I had not relied upon in the least I dont think I
thought about being drowned I said

That proves it she cried in triumph Your confidence was so perfect
that it was unconscious Sweetest motherthere I wont say another
word not another syllable mother mine shall pass your daughters
lips But one does like to show ones self in the right doesnt one
Miss Wickand Mrs Stacy surrendered to an impulsive volume of
embraces which descended from behind the sofa chiefly upon the back of
her neck

How pleasant it was that five oclock teadrinking in the oldfashioned
drawingroom with the jessamine nodding in at the window and all
the family cats gathered upon the hearthrugfive in number with one
kitten The Stacys compromise in the perpetuallyrecurring problem of
new kittens was to keep only the representative of a single generation
for family affection and drawingroom privileges The rest were
obscurely brought up in the stables and located as early as was entirely
humane with respectable cottagers or darkly spoken of as kitchen
cats There had been only one break in the line of posterity that
gravely licked itself on the rug or besought small favours rubbingly
with purrsmade by a certain Satanella who ate her kittens and
suffered banishment in consequence But this was confided to me in
undertones by the second Miss Stacy who begged me not to mention the
matter to Dorothy We dont talk about it often for Satanella was her
cat you know and she cant get over her behaving so dreadfully Each
cat had its individual history and to the greatgreatgrandmother of
them attached the thrilling tale if I remember rightly of having once
only escaped hanging by her own muscular endurance and activity but
none bore so dark a blot as covered the memory of Satanella Perhaps it
is partly owing to my own fondness for pussies but ever since I made
the acquaintance of the Stacys I must confess to disparaging a family
with no cats in it

It was naturally Dorothy who took me out to see the gardensweet shy
Dorothy who seemed so completely to have grown in a garden that Lady
Torquilin when she brought her pink cheeks afterwards to gladden the
flat in Cadogan Mansions dubbed her the Wild Rose at once At any
rate Dorothy had always lived just here beside her garden and never
anywhere else for she told me so in explaining her affection for it I
thought of the number of times we had moved in Chicago and sighed

It was not a very methodical garden Dorothy remarked in apologythe
dear sweet things mostly came up of their own accord year after year
and the only ambition Peter entertained towards it was to keep it
reasonably weeded A turn in the walk disclosed Peter at the moment with
a wheelbarrowthe factotum of garden and stable a solemn bumpkin of
twenty with a large red face and a demeanour of extreme lethargy His
countenance broke into something like a deferential grin as he passed
us Can you make him understand I asked Miss Dorothy Oh I should
think so she replied He is very intelligent From his appearance
I should not have said so There was nothing sharp as we say in
America about Peter though afterwards I beard him whistling Two
lovely black eyes with a volume of vigorous expression that made one
charge him with private paradoxical sweethearting But I was new to the
human product after many generations of the fields and hedges

It was a square garden shut in from the road and the neighbours by that
high old redbrick wall A tenniscourt lay in the middle in the sun
the house broke into a warmlytinted gable redroofed and plastered and
quaint that nestled over the little maids in the larder I think
at one end a tall elm and a spreading horsechestnut helped the
laurestinus bushes to shut it in from the lawns and the drive and
any eyes that might not fall upon it tenderly We sat down upon the
gardenseat that somebody had built round the elm Dorothy and I and I
looked at the garden as one turns the pages of an old storybook There
were the daisies in the grass to begin with all over by hundreds and
thousands turning their bright little whiteandyellow faces up at
me and saying somethingI dont know quite what I should have had to
listen a long time to be sure it was anything but Dont step on me
but I had a vague feeling that every now and then one said Cant you
remember Dorothy remarked it was really disgraceful so many of them
and Peter should certainly mow them all down in the morningby which
her pretty lips gave me a keen pang Oh I said I what a pity
Yes she said relentingly they are dear things but theyre very
untidy The worst of Peter is she went on with a shade of reflection
that we are obliged to keep at him

I dare say you dont think much of daisies in the grassyou have always
had so many You should have been brought up on dandelions insteadin
Chicago

Then there were all the sweet spring English flowers growing in little
companies under the warm brick wallviolets and pansies and yellow
daffodils and in one corner a tall brave array of anemones red
and purple and white And against the wall rosebushes and an ancient
figtree and farther on all massed and tangled in its own darkgreen
shadows the ivy pouring out its abundant heart to drape and soften the
other angle and catch the golden rain of the laburnum that hung over
And this English Dorothy with her yellow hair and youngeyed innocence
the essence and the flower of it all

Near the stables in our roundabout ramble to the kitchengarden
Dorothy showed me with seriousness a secluded corner holding two
small mounds and two small wooden tablets On one the head of a spaniel
was carved painstakingly and painted with the inscription Here Lies a
Friend The second tablet had no basrelief and a briefer legend Here
Lies Another Jack said she with a shade of retrospection and
Jingo Jack died inlet me seeeighteen eightyfive Jingo two years
later in eighteen eightyseven I didnt do Jingos picture Miss
Dorothy went on pensively It wasnt really necessary they were so
very much alike

About the kitchengarden I remember only how rampant the
gooseberrybushes were how portentous the cabbages and how the whole
Vegetable Kingdom combined failed to keep out a trailing company of
early pink roses that had wandered in from politer regions to watch the
last of the sunset across the river and beyond the fields

I have a letter to send said Miss Dorothy and as we go to the
postoffice you shall see Hallington So we went through the gates that
closed upon this dear inner world into the winding road It led us past
The Green Lion amiably couchant upon a creaking sign that swung from
a yellow cottage past a cluster of little houses with great brooding
roofs of straw past the village school in a somewhat bigger cottage
in one end whereof the schoolmistress dwelt and looked out upon her
lavender and rue to the postoffice at the top of the hill where the
little woman inside in a round frilled cap and spectacles and her
shawl pinned tidily across her breast sold buttons and thread and
sweeties and ginger ale and other things My eye lighted with
surprise upon a row of very familiar wedgeshaped tins all blue and
red They contained corned beef and they came from Chicago I know the
gentleman who puts those up very well I said to Miss Dorothy Stacy
Mr W P Hitt of Chicago He is a great friend of poppas Really
said she with slight embarrassment Does hedoes he do it himself
How clever of him

On the way back through the village of Hallington we met several stolid
little girls by ones and twos and threes and every little girl as we
approached suddenly lowered her person and her petticoats by about six
inches and brought it up again in a perfectly straight line and without
any change of expression whatever It seemed to me a singular and
most amusing demonstration and Miss Dorothy explained that it was a
curtseya very proper mark of respect But surely she said your
little cottager girls in America curtsey to the ladies and gentlemen
they meet And Miss Dorothy found it difficult to understand just why
the curtsey was not a popular genuflection in America even if we had
any little cottager girls to practise it which I did not think we had
exactly

Later on we gathered round a fire with the cats under the quaint old
portraits of very straightbacked deadandgone ladies Stacy in the
drawingroom and I told all I knew about the Apache Indians and Niagara
Falls I think I also set the minds of the Stacy family at rest about
the curious idea that we want to annex Canadathey had some
distant relations there I believe whom they did not want to see
annexedalthough it appeared that the relations had been heterodox on
the subject and had said they wouldnt particularly mind I suggested
that they were probably stockraising in the Northwest out there and
found our tariff inconvenient and the Stacys said Yes they were
I continued that the union they would like to see was doubtless
commercial and not political and the Stacys when they thought of
this became more cheerful Further on the Squire handed me a silver
candlestick at the foot of the stairs with the courtliness of three
generations past and as I went to bed by candlelight for the first
time in my life I wondered whether I would not suddenly arrive like
this at the end of a chapter and find that I had just been reading one
of Rhoda Broughtons novels But in the morning it came in at the
window with the scent of the lilacs and I undoubtedly heard it
againCuckooCuckoo





XXVII

HAVENT you some letters child to your Ambassador or whatever he is
here in London asked Lady Torquilin one morning

Why yes I said I have Id forgotten about them He is quite an
old friend of poppasin a political way but poppa advised me not to
bother him so long as I wasnt in any difficultyhe must have such lots
of Americans coming over here for the summer and fussing round every
year you know And I havent been

Well you must now declared Lady Torquilin for I want you to go to
Court with me a fortnight from today Its five years since Ive
gone and quite time I should put in an appearance again Besides the
Maffertons wish it

The Maffertons wish it I said Dear me I consider that extremely
kind I suppose they think I would enjoy it very much And I dare say I
should

Lady Mafferton and I talked it over yesterday Lady Torquilin
continued and we agreed that although either she or I might present
you it would be more properly done on account of your being an
American by your American mans wife Indeed I dare say its
obligatory So we must see about it And Lady Torquilin and Lady
Mafferton with very little assistance from me saw about it

In the moment that succeeded the slight shock of the novel idea I found
a certain delirium in contemplating it that I could not explain by any
of the theories I had been brought up upon It took entire possession of
meI could not reason it away Even in reading my home letters which
usually abstracted mo altogether for the time I saw it fluttering round
the corners of the pages What would they say I thought if they
knew I was going to be presented to the Queentheir daughter Mamie
Wick of Illinois Would they consider that I had compromised
the strict Republican principles of the family and reprobate the
proceeding The idea gave me a momentary consciencechill which soon
passed off however under the agreeable recollection of poppas having
once said that he considered Her Majesty a very fine woman and for
his part he would be proud to be introduced to her After all being
presented was only a way of being introduced to herthe way they do it
in England I felt pretty sure the family principles could stand
that much As a matter of fact you know very few Americans have any
personal objection to royalty And I dismissed the idea abandoning
myself to the joy of preparation which Lady Torquilin decreed should
begin the very next day I thought this though pleasurable rather
unnecessary at first Dear Lady Torquilin said I in the discussion
of our Court dresses cant we see about them next weekwe planned so
many other things for this one

Child child returned Lady Torquilin impressively in the coming
fortnight we have barely time You must know that we dont do things by
steam and electricity in this country You cant go to Court by pressing
a button We havent a moment to lose And as to other arrangements
we must just give everything up so as to have our minds free and
comfortable till we get the whole business over Afterwards about the
seventh time I had my Court dress tried on I became convinced that Lady
Torquilin was right You do nothing by steam and electricity in this
country I found that it took ten days to get a pair of satin slippers
made Though of course if you were not quite so particular miss
about that too or if you ad come about them sooner we could ave
obliged you in less time the shoemaker said In less time A Chicago
firm would have made the slippers gone into liquidation had a clearing
sale and reopened business at the old stand in less time

I like to linger over that fortnights excitementits details were so
novel and so fascinating First the vague and the general the creation
of two gowns for an occasion extraordinary mentioned by head ladies in
establishments where a portrait of Her Majesty hung suggestively on the
wall almost with bated breath Lady Torquilin for once counselled a
mild degree of extravagance and laughed at my ideasthough she usually
respected them about clotheswhen I laid out for her inspection three
perfectly fresh New York dresses quite ideal in their way and asked
her if any of thom would do You have a great deal to learn child
she said No they wont indeed Who ever heard of attending one of
Her Majestys DrawingRooms in a frock made in New York Im not saying
you havent very nice taste over there my dear for that you have
but it stands to reason that your dressmakers not having Court
instructions cant be expected to know anything about Court trains
doesnt it From which there was no appeal so that the next day or
two went in deep conferences with the head ladies aforesaid and absorbed
contemplation of resultant patternswhich Lady Torquilin never liked to
hear me call samples I was spared the trial of deciding upon a colour
combination being a young lady I was to go in white Lady Torquilin
gave me to understand by edict of the Court But should I have the
train or the petticoat of the brocade or would I prefer a bengaline
train with a bodice and petticoat of crpe de chine Should the train
come from the shoulder or be fulled in at the waist and what did I
really think myself about ostrich tips grouped down one side or bunches
of field flowers dispersed upon the petticoat or just a suggestion of
silver embroidory gleaming all through or perhaps mademoiselle might
fancy an Empress gown which would be thoroughly good stylethey had
made three for the last DrawingRoom I had never been so wrought up
about any dress before Privately I compared it to Lady Torquilin with
the fuss that is made about a weddingdress My dear she exclaimed
candidly a weddingdress is nothing to it as I dare say she added
roguishly pinching my cheek in a way she had it wont be long before
you find out But I dont think Lady Torquilin really know at the time
anything about this

It was not too much to say that those two Court dressesLady Torquilin
was going in a cheme of pansycoloured velvet and holiotropehaunted
our waking and sleeping hours for quite five days Peter Corke dropping
in almost at the beginning declared it a disgraceful waste of time
with the whole of Chelsea a deadletter to me and came again almost
every afternoon that week to counsel and collaborate for an hour and a
half I may say that Miss Corke took the matter in hand vigorously It
was probably a detail in the improvement of my mind and my manners which
she could not conscientiously overlook Since you have the audacity to
wish to kiss the hand of a sovereign who is none of yours said she
with her usual twinkle youll kindly see that you do it properly
miss So she gave us explicit instructions as to the right florist
and glover and laceman and hairdresser to which even Lady Torquilin
listened with respect and do not be persuaded said she with
mocksevere emphasis to go to anybody else These people are dear
but you are perfectly safe with them and thats important dont you
think Peter even brought over a headdress she wore herself the season
before to get the American effect she said and offered to lend it
to me It consisted of three white ostrich feathers and a breadth of
Brussels net about a yard and a half long hanging down behind and I
found it rather trying as an adornment So I told her I was very much
obliged but I didnt consider it becoming and I thought I would go
with nothing on my head At which she screamed her delightful little
scream and said indeed I wouldnt if the Lord Chamberlain had anything
to say in the matter And when I found out just how much the Lord
Chamberlain had to say in the matterhow he arranged the exact length
of my train and cut of my bodice and what I wore in my hairthe whole
undertaking while it grew in consequence grew also in charm It was
interesting in quite a novel way to come within the operation of these
arbitrary requirements connected with the person of royalty I liked
getting ready to go to Court infinitely better than if I had been able
to do it quite my own way and the Lord Chamberlain had had nothing to
do with it I enjoyed his interference This was hard to reconcile
with democratic principles too I intend to read up authorities in
AngloAmerican fiction who may have dealt with the situation when I
get home to see if they shed any light upon it just for my own
satisfaction But I think it is a good thing that the Lord Chamberlains
authority stops where it does It would be simple tyranny if he were
allowed to prescribe colours for middleaged ladies for instance and
had commanded Lady Torquilin to appear in yellow which is almost the
only colour she cant wear As it was he was very nice indeed about
it allowing her to come in a Vshaped bodice on account of her
predisposition to bronchitis but she had to write and ask him very
politely indeed He told her by return postof course it was not a
private letter but a sort of circularjust which dressmakers had the
V shaped patterns the Queen liked best in such cases as hers and Lady
Torquilin at once obtained them After that she said she had no further
anxietythere was nothing like going straight to the proper sources for
information to have a comfortable mind With that letter if anything
went wrong the Lord Chamberlain could clearly be made responsibleand
what did one want more than that

One thing that surprised me during that fortnight of preparation was
the remarkable degree of interest shown in our undertaking by all our
friends I should have thought it an old story in London but it seemed
just as absorbing a topic to the ladies who came to see Lady Torquilin
on her day and who had lived all their lives in England as it was to
me They were politely curious upon every detail they took another
cup of tea and said it was really an ordeal they seemed to take a
sympathetic pleasure in being as it were in the swirl of the tide that
was carrying us forward to the Royal presence If the ladies had been
presented themselves they gave us graphic and varying accounts of the
occasion to which we listened with charmed interest if not they
brought forth stories if anything more thrilling of what had happened
to other people they knew or had heard ofthe lady whose diamond
necklace broke as she bent the lady who forgot to take the silver paper
out of her train at home and left it in the arms of the Gentlemen of
the Court as she sailed forward the lady who was attacked by violent
hysteria just as she passed the Duke of Edinburgh Miss Corkes
advicethough we relied upon nobody elsewas supplemented fifty times
and one lady left us at halfpast six in the afternoon almost in tears
because she had failed to persuade me to take a few lessons at a
guinea a lesson from a French lady who made a specialty of debutante
presentations I think I should have taken them the occasion found me
with so little selfreliance if it had not been for Lady Torquilin But
Lady Torquilin said No certainly not it was a silly waste of money
and she could show me everything that was necessary for all practical
purposes as well as Madame Anybody So several mornings we had little
rehearsals Lady Torquilin and I after breakfast in my room by
which I profited much We did it very simply with a towel and whatever
flowers were left over from dinner the night before I would pin the
towel to my dress behind and hold the flowers and advance from the
other end of the room to Lady Torquilin who represented Her Majesty
and gave me her hand to kiss I found the curtsey difficult at first
especially the getting up part of it and Lady Torquilin was obliged to
give me a great deal of practice

 Remember one thing about the Queens hand absolutely child said she Youre not under any circumstances whatever to help yourself up by it And then I would be the Queen and Lady Torquilin just to get into the way of it again would pin on the towel and carry the roses and curtsey to me

I KNOW I shall enjoy writing this chapter I enjoyed its prospective
contents so much To be perfectly candid I liked going to Court better
than any other thing I did in England not excepting Madame Tussauds
or the Beefeaters at the Tower or even Our Flat at the Strand It
did a great deal to reconcile me practically with monarchical
institutions although chiefly on poppas account I should like it to
be understood that my democratic theories are still quite unshaken in
every respect

It seems to me looking back upon it that we began to go very early in
the morning I remember a vision of long white boxes piled up at the end
of the room through the grey of dawn and a very short nap afterwards
before the maid came knocking with Lady Torquilins inquiries as to how
I had slept and did I remember that the hairdresser was coming at nine
sharp It was a gentle knock but it seemed to bristle with portent as I
heard it and brought with it the swift realisation that this was Friday
at lastthe Friday on which I should see Queen Victoria And yet of
course to be quite candid that was only half the excitement the knock
brought the other half was that Queen Victoria should see me for an
instant and as an individual There was a very gratifying flutter in
that

The hairdresser was prompt She came just as Charlotte was going out
with the tray Lady Torquilin having decreed that we should take
our morning meal in retirement She was a kind pleasant loquacious
hairdresser

Im glad to see youve been able to take a good breakfast miss she
said as she puffed and curled me Thats alf the battle She was
sorry that she had to come to us so early but not until two oclock
miss do I expect to be for one moment off my feet what with Ontry
ladys who dont wish to be done till theyre just getting into their
carriagesthough for that I dont blame them miss and nobody could
Im afraid youll find these lappits very wearing on the nerves before
the day is out But Ill just pin them up so missand of course you
must do as best pleases you but my advice would be dont let them down
for anybody miss till you start But I was not sorry the hairdresser
came so early It would have been much more wearing on the nerves to
have waited for her

Perhaps you will find it difficult to understand the interest with which
I watched my own development into a lady dressed for Court Even the
most familiar details of costume seemed to acquire a new meaning and
importance while those of special relevance had the charm that might
arise from the mingling of a very august occasion with a fancydress
ball When I was quite ready it seemed to me that I was a different
person very pretty very tall with a tendency to look backward over
my shoulder wearing as well as a beautiful sweeping gown a lofty
and complete set of monarchical prejudices which I thought becoming in
masquerade I was too much fascinated with my outward self I could have
wished for an instant that the Declaration of Independence was hanging
about somewhere framed

Then the advent of the big square wooden box from the florists and
the gracious wonder of white roses and grasses inside with little buds
dropping and caught in its trailing ribbonsthere is a great deal of
the essence of a Royal function in a DrawingRoom bouquet And then Lady
Torquilin with a new graciousness and dignity quite a long way off
if I had not been conscious of sharing her state for the time Lady
Torquilins appearance gave me more ideas about my own than the
pierglass did Dear me I thought with a certain rapture do I
really look anything like that

We went down in the lift one at a time with Charlotte as trainbearer
and the other maids furtively admiring from the end of the hall Almost
everybody in Cadogan Mansions seemed to be going out at about the same
time and a small crowd had gathered on each side of the strip of
carpet that led from the door to the carriage It was Lady Maffertons
carriage lent for the occasion and the footman and coachman were as
impressive as powder and buff and brass buttons would make them In
addition they wore remarkable floral designs about the size and shape
of a cabbageleaf upon their breasts immediately under their chins That
was another thing that could not have been done with dignity in America

The weather looked threatening as we drove off precisely at twelve
oclock and presently it began to rain with great industry and
determination The drops came streaming down outside the carriage
windows fewer people as we passed leaned out of hansoms to look at us
Inside the Mafferton carriage we were absurdly secure from the weather
we surveyed our trains piled up on the opposite seat with complacency
we took no thought even for the curl of our feathers We counted as
we drove past them to take our place and there were forty carriages in
line ahead of us Then we stopped behind the last in the middle of
a wide road heavily bordered under the trees with damp people and
dripping umbrellasthere for the spectacle All kinds of people and all
kinds of umbrellas I noticed with interestladies and gentlemen and
little seamstresses and loafers and ragamuffins and applewomen and a
large proportion of your respectable lower middleclass We sat in state
amongst them in the rain being observed and liking it I heard my
roses approved and the nape of my neck and Lady Torquilins diamonds
I also heard it made very unpleasant for an elderly young lady in the
carriage in front of ours whose appearance was not approved by a pair
of candid newsboys The policemen kept the people off however they
could only approach outside a certain limit and there they stood or
walked up and down huddled together in the rain and complaining of the
clouded carriage windows I think there came to me then sitting in the
carriage in the warmth and pride and fragrance and luxuriance of it all
one supreme moment of experience when I bent my head over my roses and
looked out into the rainone throb of exulting pleasure that seemed
to hold the whole meaning of the thing I was doing and to make its
covetable nature plain I find my thoughts centre looking back upon
that one moment

It was three oclock before we moved again In the hours that came
between we had nothing to do but smell our flowers discuss the people
who drove past to take places farther down the line congratulate
ourselves upon being fortyfirst and eat tiny sandwiches done up in
tissue paper with serious regard for the crumbs yet the time did not
seem at all long Mr Oddie Pratte who was to escort us through the
palace and home again made an incident dashing up in a hansom on his
way to the club to dress but that was all And once Lady Torquilin had
the footman down to tell him and his brotherfunctionary under the big
umbrella to put on their rubber coats Thank you my lady said the
footman and went back to the box but neither of them took advantage of
the permission They were going to Court too and knew what was seemly
And the steamy crowd stayed on till the last

Original RESENTLY when we were not in the least expecting it there came a little sudden jolt that made us look at each other precipitately Lady Torquilin was quite as nervous as I at this point What has become of Oddie she exclaimed and descried a red coat in a cab rolling up beside us with intense relief As we passed through the Palace gates the cab disappeared and chaos came again

 Naughty boy said Lady Torquilin in bitterness of spirit Why in the name of fortune couldnt he have come with us in the carriage Men have no nerves my dear none whatever and they cant understand our having them But at that moment we alighted in a maze of directions upon the wide redcarpeted steps and whisked as rapidly as possible through great corridors with knots of gentlemen in uniform in them to the cloakroom Hurry child whispered Lady Torquilin handing our wraps to the whitecapped maid Dont let these people get ahead of us and keep close to meand I observed the same spasmodic haste in everybody else With our trains over our arms we fled after the others as rapidly as decorum would permit through spacious halls and rooms that lapse into a red confusion in my recollection leaving one of my presentation cards somewhere on the way and reaching the limit of permitted progress at last with a strong sense of security and comfort We found it in a large pillared room full of regularlycurving lines of chairs occupied by the ladies of the forty carriages that were before us Every head wore its three white feathers and its tulle extension and the aggregation of plumes and lappets and gentle movements made one in the rear think of a flock of tame pigeons nodding and peckingit was very quaint as Lady Torquilin said when I pointed it out The dresses of these ladies immediately became a source of the liveliest interest to us as ours were apparently to those who sat near us In fact I had never seen such undisguised curiosity of a polite kind before But then I do not know that I had ever been in the same room with so many jewels and brocades and rare orchids and drooping feathers and patrician features before so perhaps this is not surprising A few gentlemen were standing about the room holding fans and bouquets leaning over the backs of the ladies chairs and looking rather distraught in very becoming costumes of black velvet and silk stockings and shoebuckles and officers in uniform were scattered through the room looking as if they felt rather more important than the men in black as I dare say they did representing that most glorious and impressive British institution the Army while the others were only private gentlemen their own property and not connected with her Majesty in any personal way whatever

Here you are said somebody close behind us How dye do Auntie How
dye do Miss Wick Pon my word Im awfully sorry I missed you before
but youre all right arent you The brute of a policeman at the gates
wouldnt pass a hansom It was Mr Oddie Pratte of course looking
particularly handsome in his redandplaid uniform holding his helmet
in front of him in the way that people acquire in the Army and pleased
as usual with the world at large

Then may I ask how you came here sir said Lady Torquilin making a
pretence of severity

Private entree responded Mr Pratte with an assumption of grandeur
Fellow drove me up as a matter of courseno apologies They suspected
I was somebody I guess coming that way and I gave the man his exact
fare to deepen the impression Walked in Nobody said anything Its
what you call a game o bluff Auntie dear

A piece of downright impertinence said Lady Torquilin pleasantly
It was your red coat boy Now what do you think of our gowns

Mr Pratte told us what he thought of them with great amiability and
candour I had seen quite enough of him since the day at Aldershot to
permit and enjoy his opinion which even its frequent use of chic and
rico did not make in any way irreverent This young gentleman was a
connoisseur in gowns he understood them very well and we were both
pleased that he liked ours As we criticised and chaffed and chatted
a door opened at the farther end of the room and all the ladies rose
precipitately and swept forward

It was like a great shimmering wave radiant in colour breaking in a
hundred places into the foam of those dimpling feathers and streaming
lappets and it rushed with unanimity to the open door stopping there
chafing on this side of a silk rope and a Gentleman of the Court We
hurried on with the waveLady Torquilin and Mr Oddie Pratte and Iand
presently we were inextricably massed about halfway from its despairing
outer edge in an encounter of elbows which was only a little less than
furious Everybody gathered her train over her left armit made one
think of the ladies of Nepaul who wear theirs in front it is saidand
clung with one hand to her prodigious bouquet protecting her pendent
headdress with the other For pitys sake child take care of your
lappets exclaimed Lady Torquilin Look at that I looked at that
it was a ragged fragment of tulle about a quarter of a yard long
dependent from the graceful head of a young lady immediately in front of
us She did not know of her misfortune poor thing but she had a vague
and undetermined sense of woe and she turned to us with speaking eyes
Ive lost mamma she said unhappily

Where is mamma I must go to mamma And she was not such a very young
lady either But Lady Torquilin in her kindness of heart said So you
shall my dear so you shall and Mr Pratte took his aunts bouquet
and mine and held them one in each hand above the heads of the mob of
fineladyhood rather enjoying the situation I think so that we could
crowd together and allow the young lady who wanted her mamma to go and
find her Mr Oddie Pratte took excellent care of the bouquets holding
them aloft in that manner and looked so gallantly handsome doing
it that other gentlemen immediately followed his example and turned
themselves into flowery candelabra with great effect upon the
brilliancy of the scene

A sudden movement among the ladies nearest the silken barriera sudden
concentration of energy that came with the knowledge that there was
progress to be made progress to Royalty A quick heaving rush through
and beyond into another apartment full of emptiness and marble
pillars and we were once more at a standstill having conquered a few
placesbrought to a masterly inactivity by another silken cord and
another Gentleman of the Court polite but firm In the room beyond we
could see certain figures moving about at their ease with no crush and
no strugglethe ladies and gentlemen of the Private Entre With what
lofty superiority we invested them They seemed for the time to
belong to some other planet where Royal beings grew and smiled at every
streetcorner and to be on the other side of that silken barrier an
immeasurable distance off It was a distinct shock to hear an elderly
lady beside us done up mainly in amethysts recognise a cousin among
them It seemed to be selfevident that she had no right to have a
cousin there

Ill see you through the barrier said Mr Oddie Pratte and then
Ill have to leave you Ill bolt round the other way and be waiting
for you at the offdoor Auntie Id come through only Her Maj does
hate it so Not at all nice of her I call it but she cant bear the
most charming of us about on these occasions Were not good enough A
largeboned lady in frontred velvet and creamwith a diminutive major
in attendance turned to him at this and said with unction I am sure
Edwin that is not the case I have it on excellent authority that the
Queen is pleased when gentlemen come through Remember Edwin I will
not face it alone

I think you will do very well my dear Edwin responded Brace up
Pon my word I dont think I ought to go Ill join you at

If you desert me Edwin I shall die said the bony lady in a strong
undertone and at that moment the crowd broke again Oddie slipped
away and we went on exultantly two places for the major had basely and
swiftly followed Mr Pratte and his timid spouse in a last clutching
expostulation had fallen hopelessly to the rear

About twenty of us this time were let in at once The last of the
preceding twenty were slowly and singly pacing after one anothers
trains round two sides of this third big room towards a door at the
farther corner There was a most impressive silence As we got into file
I felt that the supreme moment was at hand and it was not a comfortable
feeling Lady Torquilin in front of me put a question to a gentleman
in a uniform she ought to have been afraid ofonly that nothing ever
terrified Lady Torquilin which made it less comfortable still Oh
Lord Mafferton said sheI hadnt recognised him in my nervousness and
his gold laceHow many curtseys are there to make

Nine dear lady replied this peer with evident enjoyment Its
the most brilliant DrawingRoom of the season Every Royalty who could
possibly attend is here Nine at the least

Lady Torquilins reply utterly terrified me It was confidential and
delivered in an undertone but it was full of severe meaning Im full
of rheumatism said she and I shant do it

The question as to what Lady Torquilin would do if not what was
required of her rose vividly before me and kept me company at every
step of that interminable round Am I all right she whispered
over her shoulder from the other end of that trailing length of
pansycoloured velvet Perfectly I said But there was nobody to
tell me that I was all rightI might have been a thing of shreds and
patches Somebodys roses had dropped I was walking on pink petals
What a pity And I had forgotten to take off my glove would it ever
come unbuttoned How deliberately we were nearing that door at the
farther end And how could I possibly have supposed that my heart
would beat like this It was all very well to allow ones self a little
excitement in preparation but when it came to the actual event I
reminded myself that I had not had the slightest intention of being
nervous I called all my democratic principles to my assistancenone
of them would come Remember Mamie Wick said I to myself you dont
believe in queens But at that moment I saw three Gentlemen of the
Household bending over and stretching out Lady Torquilins train into
an illimitable expanse I looked beyond and there in the midst of all
her dazzling Court stood Queen Victoria And Lady Torquilin was bending
over her hand And in another moment it would beit was my turn

I felt the touches on my own train I heard somebody call a name I had
a vague familiarity withMiss Mamie Wick I was launched at last
towards that little black figure of Royalty with the Blue Ribbon
crossing her breast and the Kohinor sparkling there Didnt you
believe in queens Miss Mamie Wick at that moment Im very much afraid
you did

And all that I remember after was going down very unsteadily before her
and just daring the lightest touch of my lips upon the gracious little
hand she laid on mine And then not getting nearly time enough to make
all of those nine curtseys to the beautiful sparkling people that
stood at the Queens left hand before two more Gentlemen of the Court
gathered up my draperies from behind my feet and threw them mercifully
over my arm for me And one awful moment when I couldnt quite tell
whether I had backed out of all the Royal presences or not made up
my mind that I had then unmade it and in agony of spirit turned and
backed again

It was over at last I had kissed the hand of the Queen of Great Britain
and Ireland andtheres no use in trying to believe anything to the
contraryI was proud of it Lady Torquilin and I regarded each other in
the next room with pale and breathless congratulation and then turned
with one accord to Oddie Pratte

On the whole said that young gentleman blandly you did me credit





XXX

I AM writing this last chapter in the top berth of a saloon cabin on
board the Cunard ss Etruria which left Liverpool June  and is
now three days out From which it will be seen that I am going home

Nothing has happened there you will be glad to hear perhaps Poppa
and Momma and all the dear ones of Mrs Portheriss Christmas card
are quite in their usual state of health The elections are not on at
present so there is no family depression in connection with poppas
political future I am not running away from the English climate either
which had begun shortly before I left to be rather agreeable I have
been obliged to leave England on account of a Misunderstanding

In order that you should quite see that nobody was particularly to
blame I am afraid I shall have to be very explicit which is in a way
disagreeable But Lady Torquilin said the day I came away that it would
have been better if I had been explicit sooner and I shall certainly
never postpone the duty again So that although I should much prefer
to let my English experiences close happily and gloriously with going
to Court I feel compelled to add here in the contracted space at
my disposal the true story of how I went to dine with Mr Charles
Maffertons father and mother and brother and sisters in Hertford
Street Mayfair

It occurred almost as soon as the family returned from the South
of France where they had been all spring you remember from
considerations affecting the health of the eldest Miss Maffertonwith
whom I had kept up from time to time a very pleasant correspondence
One day about three weeks after the DrawingRoom when Lady Torquilin
and I could scarcely ever rely upon an afternoon at home we came in to
find all the Mafferton cards again in There was a note too in which
Mrs Mafferton begged Lady Torquilin to waive ceremony and bring me
to dine with them the following evening You can guess said Mrs
Mafferton how anxious we must be to see her There was a postscript
to the invitation which said that although Charlie as we probably
knew was unfortunately out of town for a day or two Mrs Mafferton
hoped he would be back in the course of the evening

Well my dear said Lady Torquilin its easily seen that I cant go
with those Watkins people coming here But you shallIll let you
off the Watkinses It isnt really fair to the Maffertons to keep them
waiting any longer Ill write at once and say so Of course Lady
Torquilin went on under ordinary circumstances I shouldnt think of
letting you go out to dinner alone but in this casethere is sure to
be only the family you knowI dont think it matters

So Lady Torquilin wrote and when the time came lent me Charlotte to go
with me in a hansom to Hertford Street Mayfair Be sure you bring me
back a full and particular account of how they all behave child
said she as she looked me over after my toilette was made I shall be
interested to hear

A massive butler let me into the usual narrow highceiled Mayfair hall
richly lighted and luxurious the usual convenient maid in a white cap
appeared at the first landing to show the way to the proper room for
my wraps After Lady Torquilins expression of interest in how
they behaved I had been wondering whether the Maffertons had any
idiosyncrasies and I did not waste any unnecessary time in final
touches before going down to see I like people with idiosyncrasies and
lately I had been growing accustomed to those of the English nation
as a whole they no longer struck me forcibly I quite anticipated some
fresh ones and the opportunity of observing them closely

The drawingroom seemed as I went in to be full of Maffertons There
were more Maffertons than china plates on the wall than patterns on the
carpet And yet there were only the four young ladies and their mother
and father The effect was produced I think by the great similarity
between the Misses Mafferton Not in actual face or figure there were
quite perceptible differences there The likeness lay in an indefinable
shade of manner and behaviour in the subdued and unobtrusive way in
which they all got up and looked at me and at their mamma waiting until
it should be entirely proper for them to come forward They were dressed
a good deal alike in low tones of silk high necked rather wrinkling
at the shoulders and finished with lace frills at the throat and
wrists and they all wore their hair parted in the middle brushed
smoothly back over their ears and braided neatly across and across
behind I have never been sure about their agesthey might have been
anything from twentyfive to forty but Isabella whom they spoke of as
the youngest seemed to me to be the most serious and elderly of all

Mrs Mafferton was a very stout old lady with what is called a fine
face She wore a good many oldfashioned rings and a wide lace collar
over her expansive black silk and as she came heavily forward to meet
me she held out both her hands and beamed upon menot an impulsive
beam however rather a beam with an element of caution in it

You are very welcome Miss Wick Indeed we have been looking forward
to this I think you ought to let me give you a kiss

Of course I did let Mrs Mafferton give me a kissit was impossible to
refuse But I thought myself singularly favoured it did not seem at all
in accordance with the character of the family to fall upon the neck
of a stranger and embrace her by way of welcoming her to dinner I was
still further of that opinion when each of the Misses Mafferton followed
the example of their mamma and saluted me tenderly on the same cheek
But I immediately put it down to be an idiosyncrasy We are so glad to
see you at last said the eldest Yes indeed said the second We
began to think we never should said the third We really did said
the fourth

Papa said Mrs Mafferton this is Miss Wick of whom we have all
heard so much She spoke very close to the ear of an old gentleman in
an armchair screened from the fire with one leg stretched out on a
rest but he did not understand and she had to say it over again Miss
Wick of whom we have all heard so much Poor dear he does not
hear very well Mrs Mafferton added to me You must use the
speakingtrumpet I fear Miss Wick Well said old Mr Mafferton
after shaking hands with me and apologising for not rising if this is
Miss Wick I dont see why I shouldnt have a kiss too At which Mrs
Mafferton and all the young ladies laughed and protested Oh fie
papa For my part I began to think this idiosyncrasy singularly common
to the family

Then the eldest Miss Mafferton put one end of a long black
speakingtrumpet into my hand and Mr Mafferton seeing her do this
applied the other to his ear I had nothing whatever to say but
overcome with the fear of seeming rude I was raising it to my lips and
thinking hard when I felt two anxious hands upon my arm Do excuse us
exclaimed a Miss Mafferton but if you wouldnt mind holding it just a
little farther from your lips please We are obliged to tell everybody
Otherwise the voice makes quite a distressing noise in his poor ears
At which every semblance of an idea left me instantly Yet I must say
somethingMr Mafferton was waiting at the other end of the tube This
was the imbecility I gave expression to I came here in a cab I said
It was impossible to think of anything else

That was not a very propitious beginning and Mr Maffertons further
apology for not being able to take me down to dinner on the ground that
he had to be taken down by the butler himself did not help matters in
the very least At dinner I sat upon Mr Maffertons right with the
coiling length of the speakingtrumpet between us The brother came
in just before we went downa thin young man with a ragged beard a
curate Of course a curate being there we began with a blessing

Then Mrs Mafferton said I hope you wont mind our not having asked
any one else Miss Wick We were selfish enough to want you this first
evening all to ourselves

It was certainly the Mafferton idiosyncrasy to be extravagantly kind I
returned that nothing could have been more delightful for me

Except that we think that dear naughty Lady Torquilin should have come
too said the youngest Miss Mafferton It began to seem to me that none
of these young ladies considered themselves entitled to an opinion in
the first person singular

An idea appeared to be as it were a family product She was very
sorry I said

And so I am sure are we remarked Mrs Mafferton graciously from
the other end of the table It was through dear Lady Torquilin I
believe that you first met our son Miss Wick

I began to feel profoundly uncomfortableI scarcely knew exactly
why It became apparent to me that there was something in the domestic
atmosphere with which I was out of sympathy I thought the four Miss
Maffertons looked at me with too much interest and I believed that the
curate was purposely distracting himself with his soup I corroborated
what Mrs Mafferton had said rather awkwardly and caught one Miss
Mafferton looking at another in a way that expressed distinct sympathy
for me

I was quite relieved when Mrs Mafferton changed the subject by
saying So you are an American Miss Wick and I was able to tell
her something about Chicago and our methods of railway travelling Mrs
Mafferton was very pleasant about Americans she said she always found
them nice kindhearted people The curate said thoughtfully crumbling
his bread that we had a vast country over there

Francis exclaimed the Miss Mafferton who sat next to him playfully
abstracting the crumbs you know thats naughty of you Im afraid
youve come to a very nervous family Miss Wick

I felt myself blushing abominably The situation all at once defined
itself and became terrible How could I tell the Maffertons assembled
there around their dinnertable that I was not coming to their family

Burgundy miss

How could I do anything but sip my claret with immoderate absorption
and say that nervous disorders did sometimes run in families or
something equally imbecile

But Charlies nerves are as strong as possible said another Miss
Mafferton reproachfully to her sister

We had other general conversation and I spoke into Mr Maffertons
trumpet several times with a certain amount of coherence but I remember
only the points which struck me as of special interest at the time
Among them was the proposal that if I were willing Mrs Mafferton
should drive me on Tuesday weekthat would be todayto see an invalid
married sister living in Hampstead who was most anxious to welcome me
How could I say I was not willing

Then after dinner in the drawingroom Mrs Mafferton took me aside
for a little chat and told me what a good son Charles had always
been and showed me several photographs of him at earlier stages from
the time he wore a sash and pinafore Even then I remember he looked a
serious person

After which I had another little chat with two of the Misses Mafferton
together who explained what a devoted brother they had always had
in Charlie We are so glad youve been kind to him they said
impulsively Of course we havent seen him yet since our return but
his letters have told us that much I tried in vain to rack my brain
for occasions on which I had been kind to Mr Charles Mafferton and
longed for an attack of faintness or a severe headache

Indeed I said it was always your brother who was kindto Lady
Torquilin and to me At which the young ladies smiled consciously and
said something about that being perfectly natural Then just as I was
wondering whether I absolutely must wait for Charlotte to arrive in a
cab to take me home as Lady Torquilin had arranged and as the third
Miss Mafferton was telling me how noble but how uninteresting it was
of Francis to take up extreme Ritualistic views and vow himself to
celibacy the doorbell rang

Theres Charlie now exclaimed the Misses Mafferton all together

I must really go I said precipitately II promised Lady Torquilin
to be home early noting with despair by the gold clock under glass
on the mantel that it was only a quarter to tenand the American mail
goes out tomorrowat least I think it doesandand Goodnight
Mrs Mafferton Goodnight Mr Mafferton I said it very rapidly and
although they were all kind enough to meet my departure with protest I
think it was evident to them that for some reason or other I really must
go The young ladies exchanged glances of understanding I think
their idea was that I dreaded the embarrassment of meeting Mr Charles
Mafferton before his family Two of them came upstairs with me to get
my wraps and assured me in various indirect ways that they quite
understoodit was awkward

Coming down we met Mr Charles Mafferton at the door of the
drawingroom The Misses Mafferton who accompanied me turned quite
pale when they heard me assure their brother that there was not the
slightest necessity that he should accompany me home I could not
persuade him of this however and we drove away together

I am afraid I cannot possibly report the conversation that took place
between Mr Mafferton and myself in the cab Looking back upon it I
find it difficult to understand clearly as I dare say he does if he
ever thinks about it After I had made him see quite plainly that it was
utterly absolutely impossible which was not easy he left me to
infer that I had been inconsistent though I am sure I could make no
selfaccusation which would be more baseless Privately I thought the
inconsistency was his and that it was of the most glaring description
I am of opinion with all due respect to your English customs that
if Mr Mafferton desired to marry me he should have taken me to some
extent into his confidence about it He should not have made Lady
Torquilin the sole repository of the idea A single bunch of roses or
basket of fruit or box of candy addressed to me specially would have
been enough to give my thoughts a proper direction in the matter Then I
would have known what to do But I always seemed to make an unavoidable
second in Mr Maffertons attentions and accepted my share of them
generally with an inward compunction And I may say without any malice
at all that to guess of ones own accord at a developing sentiment
within the breast of Mr Mafferton would be an unlikely thing to occupy
the liveliest imagination

Perhaps Mr Mafferton did not know how his family had intended to behave
to me At all events he offered no apology for their conduct I may say
that the only thing of any consequence that resulted from our drive
was the resolution which I am carrying out on board the ss Etruria
today



The ladies steward of the Etruria a little fellow with large
blue eyes and spectacles and a drooping moustache is very polite and
attentive His devotion after Mr Maffertons seems the embodiment of
romance I shall hesitate about tipping him He has just brought me some
inspiring beeftea which accounts for those asterisks

The worst of it was Lady Torquilins scolding next morningnot that she
said anything unkind but because it gave me the idea that I had treated
her badly too I should be so sorry to think that I had treated Lady
Torquilin badly She seemed to think that I should have told her in the
very beginning that I was engaged to Mr Arthur Greenleaf Page of
the Yale University Staff She seemed to think that I should have told
everybody I dont see why especially as we are not to be married until
Christinas and one never can tell what may happen Young ladies do not
speak of these things quite so much in America as you do in England I
think They are not so openly known and discussed I must apologise to
myself for bringing Mr Page in even at this stage but it seemed to be
unavoidable

I dont know at all by the way what Arthur will say to this last of my
English experiences he may not consider it as formative as he hoped
the others would be There is only one thing that makes the thought
endurable for an instantit would have been nice to be related to the
Stacys

Just before sailing the purser supplied me with dear consolation in
the shape of a letter from Miss Peter Corke It was a characteristic
letter as we say when we want to say a thing easilybewailing
advising sternly questioning comically reprobating a little sad and
deprecating by accident then rallying to herself again with all sorts
of funny reproaches I meant to have done so much and Ive done so
little was the burden of it recurring oftenI meant to have done so
much and Ive done so little Dear Peter She cant possibly know
how much she did do though Im taking my unformed mind back to a
comparatively immature civilisation and shall probably continue to
attend a church where they use springedged cushions and incandescent
burners Peters England will always be the true England to me I shall
be able to realise it again easily with some photographs and Hares
Walks in London though I am afraid I have got all her delightful old
mossgrown facts and figures mixed up so that I couldnt write about
them over again without assistance as intelligently as before And Peter
says she doesnt mind going on in my second volume if only I wont
print it which is very good of her when one thinks that the second
volume will be American and never written at all but only lived very
quietly under the maples at Yale I hope she may be found in the last
chapter of that one too Dear Peter
