When a seedmerchant of cautious disposition and an eye to the main
chance receives from an eminent firm of jammanufacturers an extremely
large order for cloverseed his emotions are mixed Joy may be said to
predominate but with the joy comes also uncertainty Are these people
he asks himself proposing to set up as farmers of a large scale or do
they merely want the seed to give verisimilitude to their otherwise bald
and unconvincing raspberry jam On the solution of this problem
depends the important matter of price for obviously you can charge
a fraudulent jam disseminator in a manner which an honest farmer would
resent

This was the problem which was furrowing the brow of Mr Julian
Fineberg of Bury St Edwards one sunny morning when Roland Bleke
knocked at his door and such was its difficulty that only at the
nineteenth knock did Mr Fineberg raise his head

Come inthat dashed woodpecker out there he shouted for it was his
habit to express himself with a generous strength towards the junior
members of his staff

The young man who entered looked exactly like a second clerk in a
provincial seedmerchants officewhich strangely enough he chanced
to be His chief characteristic was an intense ordinariness He was a
young man and when you had said that of him you had said everything
There was nothing which you would have noticed about him except the
fact that there was nothing to notice His age was twentytwo and his
name was Roland Bleke

Please sir its about my salary

Mr Fineberg at the word drew himself together much as a British
square at Waterloo must have drawn itself together at the sight of a
squadron of cuirassiers

Salary he cried What about it Whats the matter with it You get
it dont you

Yes sir but

Well Dont stand there like an idiot What is it

Its too much

Mr Finebergs brain reeled It was improbable that the millennium could
have arrived with a jerk on the other hand he had distinctly heard
one of his clerks complain that his salary was too large He pinched
himself

Say that again he said

If you could see your way to reduce it sir

It occurred to Mr Fineberg for one instant that his subordinate was
endeavoring to be humorous but a glance at Rolands face dispelled that
idea

Why do you want it reduced

Please sir Im going to be married

What the deuce do you mean

When my salary reaches a hundred and fifty sir And its a hundred and
forty now so if you could see your way to knocking off ten pounds

Mr Fineberg saw light He was a married man himself

My boy he said genially I quite understand But I can do you better
than that Its no use doing this sort of thing in a small way From now
on your salary is a hundred and ten No no dont thank me Youre an
excellent clerk and its a pleasure to me to reward merit when I find
it Close the door after you

And Mr Fineberg returned with a lighter heart to the great cloverseed
problem

The circumstances which had led Roland to approach his employer may
be briefly recounted Since joining the staff of Mr Fineberg he had
lodged at the house of a Mr Coppin in honorable employment as porter
at the local railwaystation The Coppin family excluding domestic
pets consisted of Mr Coppin a kindly and garrulous gentleman of
sixty Mrs Coppin a somewhat negative personality most of whose life
was devoted to cooking and washing up in her underground lair Brothers
Frank and Percy gentleman of leisure popularly supposed to be engaged
in the mysterious occupation known as lookin about for somethin
 and lastly Muriel

For some months after his arrival Muriel had been to Roland Bleke
a mere automaton a something outside himself that was made only for
neatlylaid breakfast tables and silent removal of plates at dinner
Gradually however when his natural shyness was soothed by use
sufficiently to enable him to look at her when she came into the room
he discovered that she was a strikingly pretty girl bounded to the
North by a mass of auburn hair and to the South by small and shapely
feet She also possessed what we are informedwe are children in these
matters ourselvesis known as the R S V P eye This eye had met
Rolands one evening as he chumped his chop and before he knew what he
was doing he had remarked that it had been a fine day

From that wonderful moment matters had developed at an incredible speed
Roland had a nice sense of the social proprieties and he could not
bring himself to ignore a girl with whom he had once exchanged easy
conversation about the weather Whenever she came to lay his table he
felt bound to say something Not being an experienced gagger he found
it more and more difficult each evening to hit on something bright
until finally from sheer lack of inspiration he kissed her

If matters had progressed rapidly before they went like lightning then
It was as if he had touched a spring or pressed a button setting vast
machinery in motion Even as he reeled back stunned at his audacity the
room became suddenly full of Coppins of every variety known to science
Through a mist he was aware of Mrs Coppin crying in a corner of
Mr Coppin drinking his health in the remains of sparkling limado
of Brothers Frank and Percy one on each side trying to borrow
simultaneously halfcrowns and of Muriel flushed but demure making
breadpellets and throwing them in an abstracted way one by one at the
Coppin cat which had wandered in on the chance of fish

Out of the chaos as he stood looking at them with his mouth open came
the word bans and smote him like a blast of East wind

It is not necessary to trace in detail Rolands mental processes from
that moment till the day when he applied to Mr Fineberg for a
reduction of salary It is enough to say that for quite a month he was
extraordinarily happy To a man who has had nothing to do with women to
be engaged is an intoxicating experience and at first life was one
long golden glow to Roland Secretly like all mild men he had always
nourished a desire to be esteemed a nut by his fellow men and his
engagement satisfied that desire It was pleasant to hear Brothers
Frank and Percy cough knowingly when he came in It was pleasant to walk
abroad with a girl like Muriel in the capacity of the accepted wooer
Above all it was pleasant to sit holding Muriels hand and watching the
illconcealed efforts of Mr Albert Potter to hide his mortification
Albert was a mechanic in the motorworks round the corner and hitherto
Roland had always felt something of a worm in his presence Albert was
so infernally strong and silent and efficient He could dissect a car
and put it together again He could drive through the thickest traffic
He could sit silent in company without having his silence attributed to
shyness or imbecility Buthe could not get engaged to Muriel Coppin
That was reserved for Roland Bleke the nut the dasher the young man
of affairs It was all very well being able to tell a sparkplug from a
commutator at sight but when it came to a contest in an affair of the
heart with a man like Roland Albert was in his proper place third at
the pole

Probably if he could have gone on merely being engaged Roland would
never have wearied of the experience But the word marriage began to
creep more and more into the family conversation and suddenly panic
descended upon Roland Bleke

All his life he had had a horror of definite appointments An invitation
to tea a week ahead had been enough to poison life for him He was one
of those young men whose souls revolt at the thought of planning out any
definite step He could do things on the spur of the moment but plans
made him lose his nerve

By the end of the month his whole being was crying out to him in
agonized tones Get me out of this Do anything you like but get me
out of this frightful marriage business

If anything had been needed to emphasize his desire for freedom the
attitude of Frank and Percy would have supplied it Every day they made
it clearer that the man who married Muriel would be no stranger to them
It would be his pleasing task to support them too in the style to
which they had become accustomed They conveyed the idea that they went
with Muriel as a sort of bonus

                                   

The Coppin family were at high tea when Roland reached home There was
a general stir of interest as he entered the room for it was known that
he had left that morning with the intention of approaching Mr Fineberg
on the important matter of a rise in salary Mr Coppin removed his
saucer of tea from his lips Frank brushed the tail of a sardine from
the corner of his mouth Percy ate his haddock in an undertone Albert
Potter who was present glowered silently

Roland shook his head with the nearest approach to gloom which his
rejoicing heart would permit

Im afraid Ive bad news

Mrs Coppin burst into tears her invariable practise in any crisis
Albert Potters face relaxed into something resembling a smile

He wont give you your raise

Roland sighed

Hes reduced me

Reduced you

Yes Times are bad just at present so he has had to lower me to a
hundred and ten

The collected jaws of the family fell as one jaw Muriel herself seemed
to be bearing the blow with fortitude but the rest were stunned Frank
and Percy might have been posing for a picture of men who had lost their
fountain pens

Beneath the table the hand of Albert Potter found the hand of Muriel
Coppin and held it and Muriel we regret to add turned and bestowed
upon Albert a halfsmile of tender understanding

I suppose said Roland we couldnt get married on a hundred and
ten

No said Percy

No said Frank

No said Albert Potter

They all spoke decidedly but Albert the most decidedly of the three

Then said Roland regretfully Im afraid we must wait

It seemed to be the general verdict that they must wait Muriel said she
thought they must wait Albert Potter whose opinion no one had asked
was quite certain that they must wait Mrs Coppin between sobs moaned
that it would be best to wait Frank and Percy morosely devouring
bread and jam said they supposed they would have to wait And to end a
painful scene Roland drifted silently from the room and went upstairs
to his own quarters

There was a telegram on the mantel

Some fellows he soliloquized happily as he opened it wouldnt
have been able to manage a little thing like that They would have given
themselves away They would

The contents of the telegram demanded his attention

For some time they conveyed nothing to him The thing might have been
written in Hindustani

It would have been quite appropriate if it had been for it was from the
promoters of the Calcutta Sweep and it informed him that as the holder
of ticket number  he had drawn Gelatine and in recognition of
this fact a check for five hundred pounds would be forwarded to him in
due course

                                   

Rolands first feeling was one of pure bewilderment As far as he
could recollect he had never had any dealings whatsoever with these
openhanded gentlemen Then memory opened her floodgates and swept him
back to a morning ages ago so it seemed to him when Mr Finebergs
eldest son Ralph passing through the office on his way to borrow money
from his father had offered him for ten shillings down a piece of
cardboard at the same time saying something about a sweep Partly
from a vague desire to keep in with the Fineberg clan but principally
because it struck him as rather a doggish thing to do Roland had passed
over the ten shillings and there as far as he had known the matter
had ended

And now after all this time that simple action had borne fruit in the
shape of Gelatine and a check for five hundred pounds

Rolands next emotion was triumph The sudden entry of checks for five
hundred pounds into a mans life is apt to produce this result

For the space of some minutes he gloated and then reaction set in Five
hundred pounds meant marriage with Muriel

His brain worked quickly He must conceal this thing With trembling
fingers he felt for his matchbox struck a match and burnt the
telegram to ashes Then feeling a little better he sat down to think
the whole matter over His meditations brought a certain amount of balm
After all he felt the thing could quite easily be kept a secret He
would receive the check in due course as stated and he would bicycle
over to the neighboring town of Lexingham and start a bankaccount with
it Nobody would know and life would go on as before

He went to bed and slept peacefully

                                   

It was about a week after this that he was roused out of a deep sleep
at eight oclock in the morning to find his room full of Coppins Mr
Coppin was there in a nightshirt and his official trousers Mrs
Coppin was there weeping softly in a brown dressinggown Modesty had
apparently kept Muriel from the gathering but brothers Frank and Percy
stood at his bedside shaking him by the shoulders and shouting Mr
Coppin thrust a newspaper at him as he sat up blinking

These epic moments are best related swiftly Roland took the paper and
the first thing that met his sleepy eye and effectually drove the sleep
from it was this headline

   ROMANCE OF THE CALCUTTA SWEEPSTAKES

And beneath it another in type almost as large as the first

   POOR CLERK WINS 

His own name leaped at him from the printed page and with it that of
the faithful Gelatine

Flight That was the masterword which rang in Rolands brain as day
followed day The wild desire of the trapped animal to be anywhere
except just where he was had come upon him He was past the stage when
conscience could have kept him to his obligations He had ceased to
think of anything or any one but himself All he asked of Fate was to
remove him from Bury St Edwards on any terms

It may be that some inkling of his state of mind was wafted
telepathically to Frank and Percy for it can not be denied that their
behavior at this juncture was more than a little reminiscent of the
police force Perhaps it was simply their natural anxiety to keep an eye
on what they already considered their own private goldmine that made
them so adhesive Certainly there was no hour of the day when one or the
other was not in Rolands immediate neighborhood Their vigilance
even extended to the night hours and once when Roland having tossed
sleeplessly on his bed got up at two in the morning with the wild idea
of stealing out of the house and walking to London a door opened as he
reached the top of the stairs and a voice asked him what he thought he
was doing The statement that he was walking in his sleep was accepted
but coldly

It was shortly after this that having by dint of extraordinary strategy
eluded the brothers and reached the railwaystation Roland with his
ticket to London in his pocket and the express already entering the
station was engaged in conversation by old Mr Coppin who appeared
from nowhere to denounce the high cost of living in a speech that lasted
until the taillights of the train had vanished and Brothers Frank and
Percy arrived panting

A man has only a certain capacity for battling with Fate After this
last episode Roland gave in Not even the exquisite agony of hearing
himself described in church as a bachelor of this parish with the grim
addition that this was for the second time of asking could stir him to
a fresh dash for liberty

Altho the shadow of the future occupied Rolands mind almost to the
exclusion of everything else he was still capable of suffering a
certain amount of additional torment from the present and one of the
things which made the present a source of misery to him was the fact
that he was expected to behave more like a mad millionaire than a sober
young man with a knowledge of the value of money His mind trained from
infancy to a decent respect for the pence had not yet adjusted itself
to the possession of large means and the openhanded role forced upon
him by the family appalled him

When the Coppins wanted anything they asked for it and it seemed to
Roland that they wanted pretty nearly everything If Mr Coppin had
reached his present age without the assistance of a gold watch he might
surely have struggled along to the end on gunmetal In any case a man
of his years should have been thinking of higher things than mere gauds
and trinkets A like criticism applied to Mrs Coppins demand for a
silk petticoat which struck Roland as simply indecent Frank and Percy
took theirs mostly in specie It was Muriel who struck the worst blow by
insisting on a hired motorcar

Roland hated motorcars especially when they were driven by Albert
Potter as this one was Albert that strong silent man had but one
way of expressing his emotions namely to open the throttle and shave
the paint off trolleycars Disappointed love was giving Albert a good
deal of discomfort at this time and he found it made him feel better
to go round corners on two wheels As Muriel sat next to him on these
expeditions Roland squashing into the tonneau with Frank and Percy his
torments were subtle He was not given a chance to forget and the only
way in which he could obtain a momentary diminution of the agony was to
increase the speed to sixty miles an hour

It was in this fashion that they journeyed to the neighboring town of
Lexingham to see M Etienne Feriaud perform his feat of looping the loop
in his aeroplane

It was Brother Franks idea that they should make up a party to go and
see M Feriaud Franks was one of those generous unspoiled natures
which never grow blas at the sight of a fellow human taking a
sporting chance at harakiri He was a wellknown figure at every wild
animal exhibition within a radius of fifty miles and M Feriaud drew
him like a magnet

The blighter goes up he explained as he conducted the party into the
arena and then he stands on his head and goes round in circles Ive
seen pictures of it

It appeared that M Feriaud did even more than this Posters round the
ground advertised the fact that on receipt of five pounds he would
take up a passenger with him To date however there appeared to have
been no rush on the part of the canny inhabitants of Lexingham to avail
themselves of this chance of a breath of fresh air M Feriaud a small
man with a chubby and amiable face wandered about signing picture cards
and smoking a lighted cigaret looking a little disappointed

Albert Potter was scornful

Lot of rabbits he said Wheres their pluck And I suppose they call
themselves Englishmen Id go up precious quick if I had a fivepound
note Disgrace I call it letting a Frenchman have the laugh of us

It was a long speech for Mr Potter and it drew a look of respectful
tenderness from Muriel Youre so brave Mr Potter she said

Whether it was the slight emphasis which she put on the first word or
whether it was sheer generosity that impelled him one can not say but
Roland produced the required sum even while she spoke He offered it to
his rival

Mr Potter started turned a little pale then drew himself up and waved
the note aside

I take no favors he said with dignity

There was a pause

Why dont you do it said Albert nastily Five pounds is nothing to
you

Why should I

Ah Why should you

It would be useless to assert that Mr Potters tone was friendly It
stung Roland It seemed to him that Muriel was looking at him in an
unpleasantly contemptuous manner

In some curious fashion without doing anything to merit it he had
apparently become an object of scorn and derision to the party

All right then I will he said suddenly

Easy enough to talk said Albert

Roland strode with a pale but determined face to the spot where M
Feriaud beaming politely was signing a picture postcard

Some feeling of compunction appeared to come to Muriel at the eleventh
hour

Dont let him she cried

But Brother Frank was made of sterner stuff This was precisely the sort
of thing which in his opinion made for a jolly afternoon

For years he had been waiting for something of this kind He was
experiencing that pleasant thrill which comes to a certain type
of person when the victim of a murder in the morning paper is an
acquaintance of theirs

What are you talking about he said Theres no danger At least not
much He might easily come down all right Besides he wants to What do
you want to go interfering for

Roland returned The negotiations with the birdman had lasted a little
longer than one would have expected But then of course M Feriaud was
a foreigner and Rolands French was not fluent

He took Muriels hand

Goodby he said

He shook hands with the rest of the party even with Albert Potter It
struck Frank that he was making too much fuss over a trifleand worse
delaying the start of the proceedings

Whats it all about he demanded You go on as if we were never going
to see you again

You never know

Its as safe as being in bed

But still in case we never meet again

Oh well said Brother Frank and took the outstretched hand

                                   

The little party stood and watched as the aeroplane moved swiftly along
the ground rose and soared into the air Higher and higher it rose
till the features of the two occupants were almost invisible

Now said Brother Frank Now watch Now hes going to loop the loop

But the wheels of the aeroplane still pointed to the ground It grew
smaller and smaller It was a mere speck

What the dickens

Far away to the West something showed up against the blue of the
skysomething that might have been a bird a toy kite or an aeroplane
traveling rapidly into the sunset

Four pairs of eyes followed it in rapt silence





THE EPISODE OF THE FINANCIAL NAPOLEON

Second of a Series of Six Stories First published in Pictorial
Review June 


Seated with his wife at breakfast on the veranda which overlooked the
rolling lawns and leafy woods of his charming Sussex home Geoffrey
Windlebird the great financier was enjoying the morning sun to the
full His chubby features were relaxed in a smile of lazy contentment
and his wife who liked to act sometimes as his secretary found it
difficult to get him to pay any attention to his mornings mail

Theres a column in todays Financial Argus she said of which
you really must take notice Its most abusive Its about the Wildcat
Reef They assert that there never was any gold in the mine and that
you knew it when you floated the company

They will have their little joke

But you had the usual miningexperts report

Of course we had And a capital report it was I remember thinking at
the time what a neat turn of phrase the fellow had I admit he depended
rather on his fine optimism than on any examination of the mine As a
matter of fact he never went near it And why should he Its down in
South America somewhere Awful climatesnakes mosquitoes revolutions
fever

Mr Windlebird spoke drowsily His eyes closed

Well the Argus people say that they have sent a man of their own out
there to make inquiries a wellknown expert and the report will be in
within the next fortnight They say they will publish it in their next
number but one What are you going to do about it

Mr Windlebird yawned

Not to put too fine a point on it dearest the game is up The
Napoleon of Finance is about to meet his Waterloo And all for twenty
thousand pounds That is the really bitter part of it Tomorrow we sail
for the Argentine Ive got the tickets

Youre joking Geoffrey You must be able to raise twenty thousand
Its a fleabite

On paperin the form of shares script bonds promissory notes it
is a fleabite But when it has to be produced in the raw in flat hard
lumps of gold or in crackling banknotes its more like a bite from a
hippopotamus I cant raise it and thats all about it SoSt Helena
for Napoleon

Altho Geoffrey Windlebird described himself as a Napoleon of Finance a
Cinquevalli or Chung Ling Soo of Finance would have been a more accurate
title As a juggler with other peoples money he was at the head of his
class And yet when one came to examine it his method was delightfully
simple Say for instance that the Homegrown Tobacco Trust founded by
Geoffrey in a moment of ennui failed to yield those profits which the
glowing prospectus had led the public to expect Geoffrey would appease
the excited shareholders by giving them Preference Shares interest
guaranteed in the Seagold Extraction Company hastily floated to meet
the emergency When the interest became due it would as likely as not
be paid out of the capital just subscribed for the King Solomons Mines
Exploitation Association the little deficiency in the latter being
replaced in its turn when absolutely necessary and not a moment before
by the transfer of some portion of the capital just raised for yet
another company And so on ad infinitum There were moments when it
seemed to Mr Windlebird that he had solved the problem of Perpetual
Promotion

The only thing that can stop a triumphal progress like Mr Windlebirds
is when some coarse person refuses to play to the rules and demands
ready money instead of shares in the next venture This had happened
now and it had flattened Mr Windlebird like an avalanche

He was a philosopher but he could not help feeling a little galled that
the demand which had destroyed him had been so trivial He had handled
millionson paper it was true but still millionsand here he was
knocked out of time by a paltry twenty thousand pounds

Are you absolutely sure that nothing can be done persisted Mrs
Windlebird Have you tried every one

Every one dear moonofmydelightthe probables the possibles the
highly unlikelies and the impossibles Never an echo to the minstrels
wooing song No my dear we have got to take to the boats this time
Unless of course some one possessed at one and the same time of twenty
thousand pounds and a very confiding nature happens to drop from the
clouds

As he spoke an aeroplane came sailing over the tops of the trees beyond
the tennislawn Gracefully as a bird it settled on the smooth turf not
twenty yards from where he was seated

                                   

Roland Bleke stepped stiffly out onto the tennislawn His progress
rather resembled that of a landsman getting out of an open boat in
which he has spent a long and perilous night at sea He was feeling more
wretched than he had ever felt in his life He had a severe cold He had
a splitting headache His hands and feet were frozen His eyes smarted
He was hungry He was thirsty He hated cheerful M Feriaud who had
hopped out and was now busy tinkering the engine a gay Provencal air
upon his lips as he had rarely hated any one even Muriel Coppins
brother Frank

So absorbed was he in his troubles that he was not aware of Mr
Windlebirds approach until that pleasant portly mans shadow fell on
the turf before him

Not had an accident I hope Mr Bleke

Roland was too far gone in misery to speculate as to how this genial
stranger came to know his name As a matter of fact Mrs Windlebird
keen student of the illustrated press had recognized Roland by his
photograph in the Daily Mirror In the course of the twenty yards walk
from house to tennislawn she had put her husband into possession of
the more salient points in Rolands history It was when Mr Windlebird
heard that Roland had forty thousand pounds in the bank that he sat up
and took notice

Lead me to him he said simply

Roland sneezed

Doe accident thag you he replied miserably Somethigs gone wrong
with the worgs but its nothing serious worse luck

M Feriaud having by this time adjusted the defect in his engine rose
to his feet and bowed

Excuse if we come down on your lawn But not long do we trespass See
mon ami he said radiantly to Roland all now O K We go on

No said Roland decidedly

No What you meanno

A shade of alarm fell on M Feriauds weatherbeaten features The
eminent birdman did not wish to part from Roland Toward Roland he
felt like a brother for Roland had notions about payment for little
aeroplane rides which bordered upon the princely

But you saytake me to France with you

I know But its all off Im not feeling well

But its all wrong M Feriaud gesticulated to drive home his point
You give me one hundred pounds to take you away from Lexingham Good
It is here He slapped his breast pocket But the other two hundred
pounds which also you promise me to pay me when I place you safe in
France where is that my friend

I will give you two hundred and fifty said Roland earnestly to
leave me here and go right away and never let me see your beastly
machine again

A smile of brotherly forgiveness lit up M Feriauds face The generous
Gallic nature asserted itself He held out his arms affectionately to
Roland

Ah now you talk Now you say something he cried in his impetuous
way Embrace me You are all right

Roland heaved a sigh of relief when five minutes later the aeroplane
disappeared over the brow of the hill Then he began to sneeze again

Youre not well you know said Mr Windlebird

Ive caught cold Weve been flying about all nightthat French ass
lost his bearingsand my suit is thin Can you direct me to a hotel

Hotel Nonsense Mr Windlebird spoke in the bluff breezy voice which
at many a stricken boardmeeting had calmed frantic shareholders as
if by magic Youre coming right into my house and up to bed this
instant

It was not till he was between the sheets with a hotwater bottle at his
toes and a huge breakfast inside him that Roland learned the name of his
good Samaritan When he did his first impulse was to struggle out of
bed and make his escape Geoffrey Windlebirds was a name which he had
learned in the course of his mercantile career to hold in something
approaching reverence as that of one of the mightiest business brains of
the age

To have to meet so eminent a man in the capacity of invalid a nuisance
about the house was almost too much for Rolands shrinking nature The
kindness of the Windlebirdsand there seemed to be nothing that they
were not ready to do for himdistressed him beyond measure To have a
really great man like Geoffrey Windlebird sprawling genially over
his bed chatting away as if he were an ordinary friend was almost
horrible Such condescension was too much

Gradually as he became convalescent Roland found this feeling replaced
by something more comfortable They were such a genuine simple kindly
couple these Windlebirds that he lost awe and retained only gratitude
He loved them both He opened his heart to them It was not long before
he had told them the history of his career skipping the earlier years
and beginning with the entry of wealth into his life

It makes you feel funny he confided to Mr Windlebirds sympathetic
ear suddenly coming into a pot of money like that You dont seem
hardly able to realize it I dont know what to do with it

Mr Windlebird smiled paternally

The advice of an older man who has had if I may say so some little
experience of finance might be useful to you there Perhaps if you
would allow me to recommend some sound investment

Roland glowed with gratitude

Theres just one thing Id like to do before I start putting my money
into anything Its like this

He briefly related the story of his unfortunate affair with Muriel
Coppin Within an hour of his departure in the aeroplane his conscience
had begun to trouble him on this point He felt that he had not acted
well toward Muriel True he was practically certain that she didnt
care a bit about him and was in love with Albert the silent mechanic
but there was just the chance that she was mourning over his loss and
anyhow his conscience was sore

Id like to give her something he said How much do you think

Mr Windlebird perpended

Ill tell you what Ill do Ill send my own lawyer to her withsay
a thousand poundsnot a check you understand but one thousand golden
sovereigns that he can show herroll about on the table in front of her
eyes Thatll console her Its wonderful the effect money in the raw
has on people

Id rather make it two thousand said Roland He had never really
loved Muriel and the idea of marrying her had been a nightmare to him
but he wanted to retreat with honor

Very well make it two thousand if you like Tho I dont quite know
how old Harrison is going to carry all that money

As a matter of fact old Harrison never had to try On thinking it
over after he had cashed Rolands check Mr Windlebird came to the
conclusion that seven hundred pounds would be quite as much money as it
would be good for Miss Coppin to have all at once

Mr Windlebirds knowledge of human nature was not at fault Muriel
jumped at the money and a letter in her handwriting informed Roland
next morning that his slate was clean His gratitude to Mr Windlebird
redoubled

And now said Mr Windlebird genially we can talk about that money
of yours and the best way of investing it What you want is something
which without being in any way what is called speculative nevertheless
returns a fair and reasonable amount of interest What you want is
something sound something solid yet something with a bit of a kick to
it something which cant go down and may go soaring like a rocket

Roland quietly announced that was just what he did want and lit another
cigar

Now look here Bleke my boy as a general rule I dont give tipsBut
Ive taken a great fancy to you Bleke and Im going to break my rule
Put your money he sank his voice to a compelling whisper put every
penny you can afford into Wildcat Reefs

He leaned back with the benign air of the Alchemist who has just
imparted to a favorite disciple the recently discovered secret of the
philosophers stone

Thank you very much Mr Windlebird said Roland gratefully I will

The Napoleonic features were lightened by that rare indulgent smile

Not so fast young man laughed Mr Windlebird Getting into Wildcat
Reefs isnt quite so easy as you seem to think Shall we say that you
propose to invest thirty thousand pounds Yes Very well then Thirty
thousand pounds Why if it got about that you were going to buy Wildcat
Reefs on that scale the market would be convulsed

Which was perfectly true If it had got about that any one was going to
invest thirty thousand poundsor pencein Wildcat Reefs the market
would certainly have been convulsed The House would have rocked with
laughter Wildcat Reefs were a standing jokeexcept to the unfortunate
few who still held any of the shares

The thing will have to be done very cautiously No one must know But I
thinkI say I thinkI can manage it for you

Youre awfully kind Mr Windlebird

Not at all my dear boy not at all As a matter of fact I shall be
doing a very good turn to another pal of mine at the same time He
filled his glass This he paused to sipthis pal of mine has a
large holding of Wildcats He wants to realize in order to put the money
into something else in which he is more personally interested Mr
Windlebird paused His mind dwelt for a moment on his overdrawn current
account at the bank In which he is more personally interested he
repeated dreamily But of course you couldnt unload thirty pounds
worth of Wildcats in the public market

I quite see that assented Roland

It might however be done by private negotiation he said I
must act very cautiously Give me your check for the thirty thousand
tonight and I will run up to town tomorrow morning and see what I
can do

                                   

He did it What hidden strings he pulled what levers he used Roland
did not know All Roland knew was that somehow by some subtle means
Mr Windlebird brought it off Two days later his host handed him twenty
thousand onepound shares in the Wildcat Reef Goldmine

There my boy he said

Its awfully kind of you Mr Windlebird

My dear boy dont mention it If youre satisfied Im sure I am

Mr Windlebird always spoke the truth when he could He spoke it now

It seemed to Roland as the days went by that nothing could mar the
pleasant easy course of life at the Windlebirds The fine weather the
beautiful garden the pleasant companyall these things combined to
make this sojourn an epoch in his life

He discovered his mistake one lovely afternoon as he sat smoking idly
on the terrace Mrs Windlebird came to him and a glance was enough to
show Roland that something was seriously wrong Her face was drawn and
tired

A moment before Roland had been thinking life perfect The only
crumpled roseleaf had been the absence of an evening paper Mr
Windlebird would bring one back with him when he returned from the city
but Roland wanted one now He was a great follower of county cricket
and he wanted to know how Surrey was faring against Yorkshire But even
this crumpled roseleaf had been smoothed out for Johnson the groom
who happened to be riding into the nearest town on an errand had
promised to bring one back with him He might appear at any moment now

The sight of his hostess drove all thoughts of sport out of his mind
She was looking terribly troubled

It flashed across Roland that both his host and hostess had been
unusually silent at dinner the night before and later passing Mr
Windlebirds room on his way to bed he had heard their voices low and
agitated Could they have had some bad news

Mr Bleke I want to speak to you

Roland moved like a sympathetic cow and waited to hear more

You were not up when my husband left for the city this morning or he
would have told you himself Mr Bleke I hardly know how to break it to
you

Break it to me

My husband advised you to put a very large sum of money in a mine
called Wildcat Reefs

Yes Thirty thousand pounds

As much as that Oh Mr Bleke

She began to cry softly She pressed his hand Roland gaped at her

Mr Bleke there has been a terrible slump in Wildcat Reefs Today
they may be absolutely worthless

Roland felt as if a cold hand had been laid on his spine

Worworthless he stammered

Mrs Windlebird looked at him with moist eyes

You can imagine how my husband feels about this It was on his advice
that you invested your money He holds himself directly responsible He
is in a terrible state of mind He is frantic He has grown so fond of
you Mr Bleke that he can hardly face the thought that he has been the
innocent instrument of your trouble

                                   

Roland felt that it was an admirable comparison His sensations were
precisely those of a leading actor in an earthquake The solid earth
seemed to melt under him

We talked it over last night after you had gone to bed and we came to
the conclusion that there was only one honorable step to take We must
make good your losses We must buy back those shares

A ray of hope began to steal over Rolands horizon

But he began

There are no buts really Mr Bleke We should neither of us know a
minutes peace if we didnt do it Now you paid thirty thousand pounds
for the shares you said Wellshe held out a pink slip of paper to
himthis will make everything all right

Roland looked at the check

Butbut this is signed by you he said

Yes You see if Geoffrey had to sign a check for that amount it would
mean selling out some of his stock and in his position with every
movement watched by enemies he can not afford to do it It might ruin
the plans of years But I have some money of my own My selling out
stock doesnt matter you see I have postdated the check a week
to give me time to realize on the securities in which my money is
invested

Rolands whole nature rose in revolt at this sacrifice If it had
been his host who had made this offer he would have accepted it
But chivalry forbade his taking this money from a woman A glow of
selfsacrifice warmed him After all what was this money of his He had
never had any fun out of it He had had so little acquaintance with it
that for all practical purposes it might never have been his

With a gesture which had once impressed him very favorably when
exhibited on the stage by the hero of the number two company of The
Price of Honor which had paid a six days visit to Bury St Edwards a
few months before he tore the check into little pieces

I couldnt accept it Mrs Windlebird he said I cant tell you how
deeply I appreciate your wonderful kindness but I really couldnt I
bought the shares with my eyes open The whole thing is nobodys fault
and I cant let you suffer for it After the way you have treated me
here it would be impossible I cant take your money Its noble and
generous of you in the extreme but I cant accept it Ive still got a
little money left and Ive always been used to working for my living
anyway soso its all right

Mr Bleke I implore you

Roland was hideously embarrassed He looked right and left for a way of
escape He could hardly take to his heels and yet there seemed no other
way of ending the interview Then with a start of relief he perceived
Johnson the groom coming toward him with the evening paper

Johnson said he was going into the town said Roland apologetically
so I asked him to get me an evening paper I wanted to see the lunch
scores

If he had been looking at his hostess then an action which he was
strenuously avoiding he might have seen a curious spasm pass over her
face Mrs Windlebird turned very pale and sat down suddenly in the
chair which Roland had vacated at the beginning of their conversation
She lay back in it with her eyes closed She looked tired and defeated

Roland took the paper mechanically He wanted it as a diversion to
the conversation merely for his interest in the doings of Surrey and
Yorkshire had waned to the point of complete indifference in competition
with Mrs Windlebirds news

Equally mechanically he unfolded it and glanced at front page and as
he did do a flaring explosion of headlines smote his eye

Out of the explosion emerged the word WILDCATS

Why he exclaimed Theres columns about Wildcats on the front page
here

Yes Mrs Windlebirds voice sounded strangely dull and toneless Her
eyes were still closed

Roland took in the headlines with starting eyes

       THE WILDCAT REEF GOLDMINE

            ANOTHER KLONDIKE

    FRENZIED SCENES ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE

         BROKERS FIGHT FOR SHARES

              RECORD BOOM

      UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN PRICES

Shorn of all superfluous adjectives and general journalistic exuberance
what the paper had to announce to its readers was this

    The special commissioner sent out by The Financial Argus to
    make an exhaustive examination of the Wildcat Reef Minewith
    the amiable view no doubt of exploding Mr Geoffrey Windlebird
    once and for all with the confiding British publichas found
    to his unbounded astonishment that there are vast quantities of
    gold in the mine

    The discovery of the new reef the largest and richest it is
    stated since the famous Mount Morgan occurred with dramatic
    appropriateness on the very day of his arrival We need scarcely
    remind our readers that until that moment Wildcat Reef shares
    had reached a very low figure and only a few optimists retained
    their faith in the mine As the largest holder Mr Windlebird
    is to be heartily congratulated on this new addition to his
    fortune

    The publication of the experts report in The Financial Argus has
    resulted in a boom in Wildcats the like of which can seldom have
    been seen on the Stock Exchange From something like one shilling
    and sixpence per bundle the one pound shares have gone up to nearly
    ten pounds a share and even at this latter figure people were
    literally fighting to secure them

The world swam about Roland He was stupefied and even terrified The
very atmosphere seemed foggy So far as his reeling brain was capable
of thought he figured that he was now worth about two hundred thousand
pounds

Oh Mrs Windlebird he cried Its all right after all

Mrs Windlebird sat back in her chair without answering

Its all right for every one screamed Roland joyfully Why if Ive
made a couple of hundred thousand what must Mr Windlebird have netted
It says here that he is the largest holder He must have pulled off the
biggest thing of his life

He thought for a moment

The chap Im sorry for he said meditatively is Mr Windlebirds
pal You know The fellow whom Mr Windlebird persuaded to sell all his
shares to me

A faint moan escaped from his hostesss pale lips Roland did not hear
it He was reading the cricket news





THE EPISODE OF THE THEATRICAL VENTURE

Third of a Series of Six Stories First published in Pictorial Review
July 


It was one of those hard nubbly rolls The best restaurants charge you
sixpence for having the good sense not to eat them It hit Roland Bleke
with considerable vehemence on the bridge of the nose For the moment
Roland fancied that the roof of the Regent Grillroom must have fallen
in and as this would automatically put an end to the party he was not
altogether sorry He had never been to a theatrical supperparty before
and within five minutes of his arrival at the present one he had
become afflicted with an intense desire never to go to a theatrical
supperparty again To be a success at these gay gatherings one must
possess dash and Roland whatever his other sterling qualities was a
little short of dash

The young man on the other side of the table was quite nice about it
While not actually apologizing he went so far as to explain that it was
old Gerry whom he had had in his mind when he started the roll on
its course After a glance at old Gerrya chinless child of about
nineteenRoland felt that it would be churlish to be angry with a young
man whose intentions had been so wholly admirable Old Gerry had one of
those faces in which any alteration even the comparatively limited
one which a roll would be capable of producing was bound to be for the
better He smiled a sickly smile and said that it didnt matter

The charming creature who sat on his assailants left however took a
more serious view of the situation

Sidney you make me tired she said severely If I had thought you
didnt know how to act like a gentleman I wouldnt have come here with
you Go away somewhere and throw bread at yourself and ask Mr Bleke to
come and sit by me I want to talk to him

That was Rolands first introduction to Miss Billy Verepoint

Ive been wanting to have a chat with you all the evening Mr Bleke
 she said as Roland blushingly sank into the empty chair Ive heard
such a lot about you

What Miss Verepoint had heard about Roland was that he had two hundred
thousand pounds and apparently did not know what to do with it

In fact if I hadnt been told that you would be here I shouldnt have
come to this party Cant stand these gatherings of nuts in May as a
general rule They bore me stiff

Roland hastily revised his first estimate of the theatrical profession
Shallow emptyheaded creatures some of them might be no doubt but
there were exceptions Here was a girl of real discernmenta thoughtful
student of charactera girl who understood that a man might sit at a
supperparty without uttering a word and might still be a man of parts

Im afraid youll think me very outspokenbut thats me all over All
my friends say Billy Verepoints a funny girl if she likes any one
she just tells them so straight out and if she doesnt like any one she
tells them straight out too

And a very admirable trait said Roland enthusiastically

Miss Verepoint sighed Praps it is she said pensively but Im
afraid its what has kept me back in my profession Managers dont like
it they think girls should be seen and not heard

Rolands blood boiled Managers were plainly a dastardly crew

But whats the good of worrying went on Miss Verepoint with a brave
but hollow laugh Of course its wearing having to wait when one has
got as much ambition as I have but they all tell me that my chance is
bound to come some day

The intense mournfulness of Miss Verepoints expression seemed to
indicate that she anticipated the arrival of the desired day not less
than sixty years hence Roland was profoundly moved His chivalrous
nature was up in arms He fell to wondering if he could do anything to
help this victim of managerial unfairness You dont mind my going on
about my troubles do you asked Miss Verepoint solicitously One so
seldom meets anybody really sympathetic

Roland babbled fervent assurances and she pressed his hand gratefully

I wonder if you would care to come to tea one afternoon she said

Oh rather said Roland He would have liked to put it in a more
polished way but he was almost beyond speech

Of course I know what a busy man you are

No no

Well I should be in tomorrow afternoon if you cared to look in

Roland bleated gratefully

Ill write down the address for you said Miss Verepoint suddenly
businesslike

                                   

Exactly when he committed himself to the purchase of the Windsor
Theater Roland could never say The idea seemed to come into existence
fullygrown without preliminary discussion One moment it was notthe
next it was His recollections of the afternoon which he spent drinking
lukewarm tea and punctuating Miss Verepoints flow of speech with
yess and nos were always so thoroughly confused that he never knew
even whose suggestion it was

The purchase of a Westend theater when one has the necessary cash
is not nearly such a complicated business as the layman might imagine
Roland was staggered by the rapidity with which the transaction was
carried through The theater was his before he had time to realize that
he had never meant to buy the thing at all He had gone into the offices
of Mr Montague with the intention of making an offer for the lease for
say six months and that wizard in the space of less than an hour had
not only induced him to sign mysterious documents which made him sole
proprietor of the house but had left him with the feeling that he had
done an extremely acute stroke of business Mr Montague had dabbled in
many professions in his time from street peddling upward but what he
was really best at was hypnotism

Altho he felt after the spell of Mr Montagues magnetism was
withdrawn rather like a nervous man who has been given a large baby
to hold by a strange woman who has promptly vanished round the corner
Roland was to some extent consoled by the praise bestowed upon him by
Miss Verepoint She said it was much better to buy a theater than to
rent it because then you escaped the heavy rent It was specious
but Roland had a dim feeling that there was a flaw somewhere in the
reasoning and it was from this point that a shadow may be said to have
fallen upon the brightness of the venture

He would have been even less selfcongratulatory if he had known the
Windsor Theaters reputation Being a comparative stranger in the
metropolis he was unaware that its nickname in theatrical circles
was The Mugs Graveyarda title which had been bestowed upon it not
without reason Built originally by a slightly insane old gentleman
whose principal delusion was that the public was pining for a constant
supply of the Higher Drama and more especially those specimens of
the Higher Drama which flowed practically without cessation from the
restless pen of the insane old gentleman himself the Windsor Theater
had passed from hand to hand with the agility of a gold watch in a
gathering of racecourse thieves The one anxiety of the unhappy man who
found himself by some accident in possession of the Windsor Theater
was to pass it on to somebody else The only really permanent tenant it
ever had was the representative of the Official Receiver

Various causes were assigned for the phenomenal illluck of the theater
but undoubtedly the vital objection to it as a Temple of Drama lay in
the fact that nobody could ever find the place where it was hidden
Cabmen shook their heads on the rare occasions when they were asked to
take a fare there Explorers to whom a stroll through the Australian
bush was childsplay had been known to spend an hour on its trail and
finish up at the point where they had started

It was precisely this quality of elusiveness which had first attracted
Mr Montague He was a farseeing man and to him the topographical
advantages of the theater were enormous It was further from a
firestation than any other building of the same insurance value in
London even without having regard to the mystery which enveloped its
whereabouts Often after a good dinner he would lean comfortably back
in his chair and see in the smoke of his cigar a vision of the Windsor
Theater blazing merrily while distracted firemen galloped madly all
over London vainly endeavoring to get some one to direct them to the
scene of the conflagration So Mr Montague bought the theater for a
mere song and prepared to get busy

Unluckily for him the representatives of the various fire offices with
which he had effected his policies got busy first The generous fellows
insisted upon taking off his shoulders the burden of maintaining the
fireman whose permanent presence in a theater is required by law
Nothing would satisfy them but to install firemen of their own and pay
their salaries This to a man in whom the instincts of the phoenix
were so strongly developed as they were in Mr Montague was distinctly
disconcerting He saw himself making no profit on the deala thing
which had never happened to him before

And then Roland Bleke occurred and Mr Montagues belief that his race
was really chosen was restored He sold the Windsor Theater to Roland
for twentyfive thousand pounds It was fifteen thousand pounds more
than he himself had given for it and this very satisfactory profit
mitigated the slight regret which he felt when it came to transferring
to Roland the insurance policies To have effected policies amounting
to rather more than seventy thousand pounds on a building so notoriously
valueless as the Windsor Theater had been an achievement of which Mr
Montague was justly proud and it seemed sad to him that so much earnest
endeavor should be thrown away

                                   

Over the little lunch with which she kindly allowed Roland to entertain
her to celebrate the purchase of the theater Miss Verepoint outlined
her policy

What we must put up at that theater she announced is a revue
A revue repeated Miss Verepoint making as she spoke little
calculations on the back of the menu we could run for about fifteen
hundred a weekor say two thousand

Saying two thousand thought Roland to himself is not quite the same as
paying two thousand so why should she stint herself

I know two boys who could write us a topping revue said Miss
Verepoint Theyd spread themselves too if it was for me Theyre in
love with meboth of them Wed better get in touch with them at once

To Roland there seemed to be something just the least bit sinister
about the sound of that word touch but he said nothing

Why there they arelunching over there cried Miss Verepoint
pointing to a neighboring table Now isnt that lucky

To Roland the luck was not quite so apparent but he made no demur to
Miss Verepoints suggestion that they should be brought over to their
table

The two boys as to whose capabilities to write a topping revue Miss
Verepoint had formed so optimistic an estimate proved to be wellgrown
lads of about fortyfive and forty respectively Of the two Roland
thought that perhaps R P de Parys was a shade the more obnoxious
but a closer inspection left him with the feeling that these fine
distinctions were a little unfair with men of such equal talents
Bromham Rhodes ran his friend so close that it was practically a dead
heat They were both fat and somewhat bulgyeyed This was due to the
fact that what revuewriting exacts from its exponents is the constant
assimilation of food and drink Bromham Rhodes had the largest appetite
in London but on the other hand R P de Parys was a better drinker

Well dear old thing said Bromham Rhodes

Well old child said R P de Parys

Both these remarks were addressed to Miss Verepoint The talented pair
appeared to be unaware of Rolands existence

Miss Verepoint struck the business note Now you stop boys she said
Tie weights to yourselves and sink down into those chairs I want you
two lads to write a revue for me

Delighted said Bromham Rhodes but

There is the trifling point to be raised first said R P de
Parys

Where is the money coming from said Bromham Rhodes

My friend Mr Bleke is putting up the money said Miss Verepoint
with dignity He has taken the Windsor Theater

The interest of the two authors in their host till then languid
increased with a jerk Has he By Jove they cried We must get
together and talk this over

It was Rolands first experience of a theatrical talkingover and he
never forgot it Two such talkersover as Bromham Rhodes and R P de
Parys were scarcely to be found in the length and breadth of theatrical
London Nothing it seemed could the gifted pair even begin to think of
doing without first discussing the proposition in all its aspects The
amount of food which Roland found himself compelled to absorb during the
course of these debates was appalling Discussions which began at lunch
would be continued until it was time to order dinner and then as
likely as not they would have to sit there till suppertime in order to
thrash the question thoroughly out

                                   

The collection of a cast was a matter even more complicated than the
actual composition of the revue There was the almost insuperable
difficulty that Miss Verepoint firmly vetoed every name suggested It
seemed practically impossible to find any man or woman in all England
or America whose peculiar gifts or lack of them would not interfere
with Miss Verepoints giving a satisfactory performance of the principal
role It was all very perplexing to Roland but as Miss Verepoint was an
expert in theatrical matters he scarcely felt entitled to question her
views

It was about this time that Roland proposed to Miss Verepoint The
passage of time and the strain of talking over the revue had to a
certain extent moderated his original fervor He had shaded off from
a passionate devotion through various diminishing tints of regard for
her into a sort of pale sunset glow of affection His principal reason
for proposing was that it seemed to him to be in the natural order of
events Her air towards him had become distinctly proprietorial She now
called him Rolypoly in publica proceeding which left him with mixed
feelings Also she had taken to ordering him about which as everybody
knows is an unmistakable sign of affection among ladies of the
theatrical profession Finally in his chivalrous way Roland had
begun to feel a little apprehensive lest he might be compromising Miss
Verepoint Everybody knew that he was putting up the money for the
revue in which she was to appear they were constantly seen together at
restaurants people looked arch when they spoke to him about her He had
to ask himself was he behaving like a perfect gentleman The answer was
in the negative He took a cab to her flat and proposed before he could
repent of his decision

She accepted him He was not certain for a moment whether he was glad
or sorry But I dont want to get married she went on until I have
justified my choice of a profession You will have to wait until I have
made a success in this revue

Roland was shocked to find himself hugely relieved at this concession

The revue took shape There did apparently exist a handful of artistes
to whom Miss Verepoint had no objection and thesea scrubby but
confident lotwere promptly engaged Sallow Americans sprang from
nowhere with songs dances and ideas for effects Tousledhaired scenic
artists wandered in with model scenes under their arms A great cloud of
chorusladies settled upon the theater like flies Even Bromham Rhodes
and R P de Parysthose human pythonsshowed signs of activity They
cornered Roland one day near Swan and Edgars steered him into the
Piccadilly Grillroom and over a hearty lunch read him extracts from
a brownpapercovered manuscript which they informed him was the first
act

It looked a battered sort of manuscript and indeed it had every right
to be Under various titles and at various times Bromham Rhodes and R
P de Parys first act had been refused by practically every responsible
manager in London As Oh What a Life it had failed to satisfy the
directors of the Empire Rechristened WowWow it had been rejected
by the Alhambra The Hippodrome had refused to consider it even under
the name of Hullo CellarFlap It was now called Pass Along
Please and according to its authors was a real revue

Roland was to learn as the days went on that in the world in which he
was moving everything was real revue that was not a stunt or a corking
effect He floundered in a sea of real revue stunts and corking
effects As far as he could gather the main difference between these
things was that real revue was something which had been stolen from some
previous English production whereas a stunt or a corking effect was
something which had been looted from New York A judicious blend of
these he was given to understand constituted the sort of thing the
public wanted

Rehearsals began before in Rolands opinion his little army was
properly supplied with ammunition True they had the first act but
even the authors agreed that it wanted bringing uptodate in parts
They explained that it was in a manner of speaking their lifework
that they had actually started it about ten years ago when they were
careless lads Inevitably it was spotted here and there with smart
topical hits of the early years of the century but that they said
would be all right They could freshen it up in a couple of evenings it
was simply a matter of deleting allusions to proBoers and substituting
lines about Marconi shares and mangelwurzels Itll be all right
 they assured Roland this is real revue

In times of trouble there is always a point at which one may say
Here is the beginning of the end This point came with Roland at the
commencement of the rehearsals Till then he had not fully realized
the terrible nature of the production for which he had made himself
responsible Moreover it was rehearsals which gave him his first clear
insight into the character of Miss Verepoint

Miss Verepoint was not at her best at rehearsals For the first time as
he watched her Roland found himself feeling that there was a case to
be made out for the managers who had so consistently kept her in the
background Miss Verepoint to use the technical term threw her weight
about There were not many good lines in the script of act one of Pass
Along Please but such as there were she reached out for and
grabbed away from their owners who retired into corners scowling and
muttering like dogs robbed of bones She snubbed everybody Roland
included

                                   

Roland sat in the cold darkness of the stalls and watched her
panicstricken Like an icy wave it had swept over him what marriage
with this girl would mean He suddenly realised how essentially domestic
his instincts really were Life with Miss Verepoint would mean perpetual
dinners at restaurants breadthrowing suppers motorrideseverything
that he hated most Yet as a man of honor he was tied to her If the
revue was a success she would marry himand revues he knew were
always successes At that very moment there were six best revues in
London running at various theaters He shuddered at the thought that
in a few weeks there would be seven

He felt a longing for rural solitude He wanted to be alone by
himself for a day or two in a place where there were no papers with
advertisements of revues no grillrooms and above all no Miss Billy
Verepoint That night he stole away to a Norfolk village where in
happier days he had once spent a Summer holidaya peaceful primitive
place where the inhabitants could not have told real revue from a
corking effect

Here for the space of a week Roland lay in hiding while his quivering
nerves gradually recovered tone He returned to London happier but a
little apprehensive Beyond a brief telegram of farewell he had not
communicated with Miss Verepoint for seven days and experience had
made him aware that she was a lady who demanded an adequate amount of
attention

That his nervous system was not wholly restored to health was borne in
upon him as he walked along Piccadilly on his way to his flat for
when somebody suddenly slapped him hard between the shoulderblades he
uttered a stifled yell and leaped in the air

Turning to face his assailant he found himself meeting the genial
gaze of Mr Montague his predecessor in the ownership of the Windsor
Theater

Mr Montague was effusively friendly and for some mysterious reason
congratulatory

Youve done it have you You pulled it off did you And in the
first monthby George And I took you for the plain ordinary mug of
commerce My boy youre as deep as they make em Whod have thought
it to look at you It was the greatest idea any one ever had and
staring me in the face all the time and I never saw it But I dont
grudge it to youyou deserve it my boy Youre a nut

I really dont know what you mean

Quite right my boy chuckled Mr Montague Youre quite right to
keep it up even among friends It dont do to risk anything and the
least said soonest mended

He went on his way leaving Roland completely mystified

Voices from his sittingroom among which he recognized the high note of
Miss Verepoint reminded him of the ordeal before him He entered with
what he hoped was a careless ease of manner but his heart was beating
fast Since the opening of rehearsals he had acquired a wholesome
respect for Miss Verepoints tongue She was sitting in his favorite
chair There were also present Bromham Rhodes and R P de Parys who
had made themselves completely at home with a couple of his cigars and
whisky from the oldest bin

So here you are at last said Miss Verepoint querulously The valet
told us you were expected back this morning so we waited Where on
earth have you been to running away like this without a word

I only went

Well it doesnt matter where you went The main point is what are you
going to do about it

We thought wed better come along and talk it over said R P de
Parys

Talk what over said Roland the revue

Oh dont try and be funny for goodness sake snapped Miss
Verepoint It doesnt suit you You havent the right shape of head
What do you suppose we want to talk over The theater of course

What about the theater

Miss Verepoint looked searchingly at him Dont you ever read the
papers

I havent seen a paper since I went away

Well better have it quick and not waste time breaking it gently
 said Miss Verepoint The theaters been burned downthats whats
happened

Burned down

Burned down repeated Roland

Thats what I said didnt I The suffragettes did it They left copies
of Votes for Women about the place The silly asses set fire to two
other theaters as well but they happened to be in main thoroughfares
and the firebrigade got them under control at once I suppose they
couldnt find the Windsor Anyhow its burned to the ground and what we
want to know is what are you going to do about it

Roland was much too busy blessing the good angels of Kingsway to reply
at once R P de Parys sympathetic soul placed a wrong construction
on his silence

Poor old Roly he said Its quite broken him up The best thing we
can do is all to go off and talk it over at the Savoy over a bit of
lunch

Well said Miss Verepoint what are you going to dorebuild the
Windsor or try and get another theater

                                   

The authors were all for rebuilding the Windsor True it would take
time but it would be more satisfactory in every way Besides at this
time of the year it would be no easy matter to secure another theater at
a moments notice

To R P de Parys and Bromham Rhodes the destruction of the Windsor
Theater had appeared less in the light of a disaster than as a direct
intervention on the part of Providence The completion of that tiresome
second act which had brooded over their lives like an ugly cloud could
now be postponed indefinitely

Of course said R P de Parys thoughtfully our contract with you
makes it obligatory on you to produce our revue by a certain datebut I
dare say Bromham we could meet Roly there couldnt we

Sure said Rhodes Something nominal say a further five hundred on
account of fees would satisfy us I certainly think it would be better
to rebuild the Windsor dont you R P

I do agreed R P de Parys cordially You see Roly our revue has
been written to fit the Windsor It would be very difficult to alter it
for production at another theater Yes I feel sure that rebuilding the
Windsor would be your best course

There was a pause

What do you think Rolypoly asked Miss Verepoint as Roland made no
sign

Nothing would delight me more than to rebuild the Windsor or to take
another theater or do anything else to oblige he said cheerfully
Unfortunately I have no more money to burn

It was as if a bomb had suddenly exploded in the room A dreadful
silence fell upon his hearers For the moment no one spoke R P de
Parys woke with a start out of a beautiful dream of prawn curry and
Bromham Rhodes forgot that he had not tasted food for nearly two hours
Miss Verepoint was the first to break the silence

Do you mean to say she gasped that you didnt insure the place

Roland shook his head The particular form in which Miss Verepoint had
put the question entitled him he felt to make this answer

Why didnt you Miss Verepoints tone was almost menacing

Because it did not appear to me to be necessary

Nor was it necessary said Roland to his conscience Mr Montague had
done all the insuring that was necessaryand a bit over

Miss Verepoint fought with her growing indignation and lost What
about the salaries of the people who have been rehearsing all this
time she demanded

Im sorry that they should be out of an engagement but it is scarcely
my fault However I propose to give each of them a months salary I
can manage that I think

Miss Verepoint rose And what about me What about me thats what I
want to know Where do I get off If you think Im going to marry you
without your getting a theater and putting up this revue youre jolly
well mistaken

Roland made a gesture which was intended to convey regret and
resignation He even contrived to sigh

Very well then said Miss Verepoint rightly interpreting this
behavior as his final pronouncement on the situation Then everythings
jolly well off

She swept out of the room the two authors following in her wake like
porpoises behind a liner Roland went to his bureau unlocked it and
took out a bundle of documents He let his fingers stray lovingly among
the fire insurance policies which energetic Mr Montague had been at
such pains to secure from so many companies

And so he said softly to himself am I





THE EPISODE OF THE LIVE WEEKLY

Fourth of a Series of Six Stories First published in Pictorial
Review August 


It was with a start that Roland Bleke realized that the girl at the
other end of the bench was crying For the last few minutes as far
as his preoccupation allowed him to notice them at all he had been
attributing the subdued sniffs to a summer cold having just recovered
from one himself

He was embarrassed He blamed the fate that had led him to this
particular bench but he wished to give himself up to quiet deliberation
on the question of what on earth he was to do with two hundred and fifty
thousand pounds to which figure his fortune had now risen

The sniffs continued Rolands discomfort increased Chivalry had always
been his weakness In the old days on a hundred and forty pounds
a year he had had few opportunities of indulging himself in this
direction but now it seemed to him sometimes that the whole world was
crying out for assistance

Should he speak to her He wanted to but only a few days ago his eyes
had been caught by the placard of a weekly paper bearing the title of
Squibs on which in large letters was the legend Men Who Speak
to Girls and he had gathered that the accompanying article was a
denunciation rather than a eulogy of these individuals On the other
hand she was obviously in distress

Another sniff decided him

I say you know he said

The girl looked at him She was small and at the present moment had
that air of the floweret surprized while shrinking which adds a good
thirtythree per cent to a girls attractions Her nose he noted was
delicately tiptilted A certain pallor added to her beauty Rolands
heart executed the opening steps of a buckandwing dance

Pardon me he went on but you appear to be in trouble Is there
anything I can do for you

She looked at him againa keen look which seemed to get into Rolands
soul and walk about it with a searchlight Then as if satisfied by the
inspection she spoke

No I dont think there is she said Unless you happen to be the
proprietor of a weekly paper with a Womans Page and need an editress
for it

I dont understand

Well thats all any one could do for megive me back my work or give
me something else of the same sort

Oh have you lost your job

I have So would you mind going away because I want to go on crying
and I do it better alone You wont mind my turning you out I hope but
I was here first and there are heaps of other benches

No but wait a minute I want to hear about this I might be ablewhat
I mean isthink of something Tell me all about it

There is no doubt that the possession of two hundred and fifty thousand
pounds tones down a diffident mans diffidence Roland began to feel
almost masterful

Why should I

Why shouldnt you

Theres something in that said the girl reflectively After all
you might know somebody Well as you want to know I have just been
discharged from a paper called Squibs I used to edit the Womans
Page

By Jove did you write that article on Men Who Speak

The hard manner in which she had wrapped herself as in a garment
vanished instantly Her eyes softened She even blushed Just a becoming
pink you know

You dont mean to say you read it I didnt think that any one ever
really read Squibs

Read it cried Roland recklessly abandoning truth I should jolly
well think so I know it by heart Do you mean to say that after
an article like that they actually sacked you Threw you out as a
failure

Oh they didnt send me away for incompetence It was simply because
they couldnt afford to keep me on Mr Petheram was very nice about
it

Whos Mr Petheram

Mr Petherams everything He calls himself the editor but hes really
everything except officeboy and I expect hell be that next week
When I started with the paper there was quite a large staff But it got
whittled down by degrees till there was only Mr Petheram and myself It
was like the crew of the Nancy Bell They got eaten one by one till
I was the only one left And now Ive gone Mr Petheram is doing the
whole paper now

How is it that he cant get anything better to do Roland said

He has done lots of better things He used to be at Carmelite House
but they thought he was too old

Roland felt relieved He conjured up a picture of a whitehaired elder
with a fatherly manner

Oh hes old is he

Twentyfour

There was a brief silence Something in the girls expression stung
Roland She wore a rapt look as if she were dreaming of the absent
Petheram confound him He would show her that Petheram was not the only
man worth looking rapt about

He rose

Would you mind giving me your address he said

Why

In order said Roland carefully that I may offer you your former
employment on Squibs I am going to buy it

After all your man of dash and enterprise your Napoleon does have
his moments Without looking at her he perceived that he had bowled
her over completely Something told him that she was staring at him
openmouthed Meanwhile a voice within him was muttering anxiously I
wonder how much this is going to cost

Youre going to buy Squibs

Her voice had fallen away to an awestruck whisper

I am

She gulped

Well I think youre wonderful

So did Roland

Where will a letter find you he asked

My name is March Bessie March Im living at twentyseven Guildford
Street

Twentyseven Thank you Good morning I will communicate with you in
due course

He raised his hat and walked away He had only gone a few steps when
there was a patter of feet behind him He turned

II just wanted to thank you she said

Not at all said Roland Not at all

He went on his way tingling with just triumph Petheram Who was
Petheram Who in the name of goodness was Petheram He had put
Petheram in his proper place he rather fancied Petheram forsooth
Laughable

A copy of the current number of Squibs purchased at a bookstall
informed him after a minute search to find the editorial page that the
offices of the paper were in Fetter Lane It was evidence of his exalted
state of mind that he proceeded thither in a cab

Fetter Lane is one of those streets in which rooms that have only just
escaped being cupboards by a few feet achieve the dignity of offices
There might have been space to swing a cat in the editorial sanctum of
Squibs but it would have been a near thing As for the outer office
in which a vacantfaced lad of fifteen received Roland and instructed
him to wait while he took his card in to Mr Petheram it was a mere
box Roland was afraid to expand his chest for fear of bruising it

The boy returned to say that Mr Petheram would see him

Mr Petheram was a young man with a mop of hair and an air of almost
painful restraint He was in his shirtsleeves and the table before
him was heaped high with papers Opposite him evidently in the act of
taking his leave was a comfortablelooking man of middle age with a
red face and a short beard He left as Roland entered and Roland was
surprized to see Mr Petheram spring to his feet shake his fist at
the closing door and kick the wall with a vehemence which brought down
several inches of discolored plaster

Take a seat he said when he had finished this performance What can
I do for you

Roland had always imagined that editors in their private offices were
less easily approached and when approached more brusk The fact was
that Mr Petheram whose optimism nothing could quench had mistaken him
for a prospective advertiser

I want to buy the paper said Roland He was aware that this was an
abrupt way of approaching the subject but after all he did want to
buy the paper so why not say so

Mr Petheram fizzed in his chair He glowed with excitement

Do you mean to tell me theres a single bookstall in London which has
sold out Great Scott perhaps theyve all sold out How many did you
try

I mean buy the whole paper Become proprietor you know

Roland felt that he was blushing and hated himself for it He ought to
be carrying this thing through with an air Mr Petheram looked at him
blankly

Why he asked

Oh I dont know said Roland He felt the interview was going all
wrong It lacked a stateliness which this kind of interview should have
had

Honestly said Mr Petheram You arent pulling my leg

Roland nodded Mr Petheram appeared to struggle with his conscience
and finally to be worsted by it for his next remarks were limpidly
honest

Dont you be an ass he said You dont know what youre letting
yourself in for Did you see that blighter who went out just now Do you
know who he is Thats the fellow weve got to pay five pounds a week to
for life

Why

We cant get rid of him When the paper started the proprietorsnot
the present onesthought it would give the thing a boom if they had
a football competition with a first prize of a fiver a week for life
Well thats the man who won it Hes been handed down as a legacy from
proprietor to proprietor till now weve got him Ages ago they tried
to get him to compromise for a lump sum down but he wouldnt Said he
would only spend it and preferred to get it by the week Well by the
time weve paid that vampire there isnt much left out of our profits
Thats why we are at the present moment a little understaffed

A frown clouded Mr Petherams brow Roland wondered if he was thinking
of Bessie March

I know all about that he said

And you still want to buy the thing

Yes

But what on earth for Mind you I ought not to be crabbing my own
paper like this but you seem a good chap and I dont want to see you
landed Why are you doing it

Oh just for fun

Ah now youre talking If you can afford expensive amusements go
ahead

He put his feet on the table and lit a short pipe His gloomy views on
the subject of Squibs gave way to a wave of optimism

You know he said theres really a lot of life in the old rag yet
If it were properly run What has hampered us has been lack of capital
We havent been able to advertise Im bursting with ideas for booming
the paper only naturally you cant do it for nothing As for editing
what I dont know about editingbut perhaps you had got somebody else
in your mind

No no said Roland who would not have known an editor from an
officeboy The thought of interviewing prospective editors appalled
him

Very well then resumed Mr Petheram reassured kicking over a heap
of papers to give more room for his feet Take it that I continue as
editor We can discuss terms later Under the present regime I have been
doing all the work in exchange for a happy home I suppose you wont
want to spoil the ship for a haporth of tar In other words you would
sooner have a happy wellfed editor running about the place than a
brokendown wreck who might swoon from starvation

But one moment said Roland Are you sure that the present
proprietors will want to sell

Want to sell cried Mr Petheram enthusiastically Why if they know
you want to buy youve as much chance of getting away from them without
the paper asaswell I cant think of anything that has such a poor
chance of anything If you arent quick on your feet theyll cry on
your shoulder Come along and well round them up now

He struggled into his coat and gave his hair an impatient brush with a
notebook

Theres just one other thing said Roland I have been a regular
reader of Squibs for some time and I particularly admire the way in
which the Womans Page

You mean you want to reengage the editress Rather You couldnt do
better I was going to suggest it myself Now come along quick before
you change your mind or wake up

Within a very few days of becoming sole proprietor of Squibs Roland
began to feel much as a man might who a novice at the art of steering
cars should find himself at the wheel of a runaway motor Young Mr
Petheram had spoken nothing less than the truth when he had said that
he was full of ideas for booming the paper The infusion of capital into
the business acted on him like a powerful stimulant He exuded ideas at
every pore

Rolands first notion had been to engage a staff of contributors He was
under the impression that contributors were the lifeblood of a weekly
journal Mr Petheram corrected this view He consented to the purchase
of a lurid serial story but that was the last concession he made
Nobody could accuse Mr Petheram of lack of energy He was willing even
anxious to write the whole paper himself with the exception of the
Womans Page now brightly conducted once more by Miss March What he
wanted Roland to concentrate himself upon was the supplying of capital
for ingenious advertising schemes

How would it be he asked one morninghe always began his remarks
with How would it beif we paid a man to walk down Piccadilly in
white skintights with the word Squibs painted in red letters across
his chest

Roland thought it would certainly not be

Good sound advertising stunt urged Mr Petheram You dont like it
All right Youre the boss Well how would it be to have a squad of
men dressed as Zulus with white shields bearing the legend Squibs See
what I mean Have them sprinting along the Strand shouting Wah Wah
Wah Buy it Buy it It would make people talk

Roland emerged from these interviews with his skin crawling with modest
apprehension His was a retiring nature and the thought of Zulus
sprinting down the Strand shouting Wah Wah Wah Buy it Buy it with
reference to his personal property appalled him

He was beginning now heartily to regret having bought the paper as
he generally regretted every definite step which he took The glow of
romance which had sustained him during the preliminary negotiations had
faded entirely A girl has to be possessed of unusual charm to continue
to captivate B when she makes it plain daily that her heart is the
exclusive property of A and Roland had long since ceased to cherish any
delusion that Bessie March was ever likely to feel anything but a
mild liking for him Young Mr Petheram had obviously staked out an
indisputable claim Her attitude toward him was that of an affectionate
devotee toward a high priest One morning entering the office
unexpectedly Roland found her kissing the top of Mr Petherams head
and from that moment his interest in the fortunes of Squibs sank to
zero It amazed him that he could ever have been idiot enough to have
allowed himself to be entangled in this insane venture for the sake
of an insignificantlooking bit of a girl with a snubnose and a poor
complexion

What particularly galled him was the fact that he was throwing away good
cash for nothing It was true that his capital was more than equal to
the on the whole modest demands of the paper but that did not alter
the fact that he was wasting money Mr Petheram always talked buoyantly
about turning the corner but the corner always seemed just as far off

The old idea of flight to which he invariably had recourse in any
crisis came upon Roland with irresistible force He packed a bag and
went to Paris There in the discomforts of life in a foreign country
he contrived for a month to forget his white elephant

He returned by the evening train which deposits the traveler in London
in time for dinner

Strangely enough nothing was farther from Rolands mind than his
bright weekly paper as he sat down to dine in a crowded grillroom near
Piccadilly Circus Four weeks of acute torment in a city where nobody
seemed to understand the simplest English sentence had driven Squibs
completely from his mind for the time being

The fact that such a paper existed was brought home to him with the
coffee A note was placed upon his table by the attentive waiter

Whats this he asked

The lady sare said the waiter vaguely

Roland looked round the room excitedly The spirit of romance gripped
him There were many ladies present for this particular restaurant
was a favorite with artistes who were permitted to look in at their
theaters as late as eightthirty None of them looked particularly
selfconscious yet one of them had sent him this quite unsolicited
tribute He tore open the envelope

The message written in a flowing feminine hand was brief and Mrs
Grundy herself could have taken no exception to it

Squibs one penny weekly buy it it ran All the mellowing effects
of a good dinner passed away from Roland He was feverishly irritated
He paid his bill and left the place

A visit to a neighboring musichall occurred to him as a suitable
sedative Hardly had his nerves ceased to quiver sufficiently to allow
him to begin to enjoy the performance when in the interval between two
of the turns a man rose in one of the side boxes

Is there a doctor in the house

There was a hush in the audience All eyes were directed toward the box
A man in the stalls rose blushing and cleared his throat

My wife has fainted continued the speaker She has just discovered
that she has lost her copy of Squibs

The audience received the statement with the bovine stolidity of an
English audience in the presence of the unusual

Not so Roland Even as the purposefullooking chuckersout wended their
leopardlike steps toward the box he was rushing out into the street

As he stood cooling his indignation in the pleasant breeze which had
sprung up he was aware of a dense crowd proceeding toward him It was
headed by an individual who shone out against the drab background like a
good deed in a naughty world Nature hath framed strange fellows in her
time and this was one of the strangest that Rolands bulging eyes had
ever rested upon He was a large stout man comfortably clad in a suit
of white linen relieved by a scarlet Squibs across the bosom His
tophat at least four sizes larger than any tophat worn out of a
pantomime flaunted the same word in letters of flame His umbrella
which tho the weather was fine he carried open above his head bore
the device One penny weekly

The arrest of this person by a vigilant policeman and Rolands dive into
a taxicab occurred simultaneously Roland was blushing all over His
head was in a whirl He took the evening paper handed in through
the window of the cab quite mechanically and it was only the strong
exhortations of the vendor which eventually induced him to pay for it
This he did with a sovereign and the cab drove off

He was just thinking of going to bed several hours later when it
occurred to him that he had not read his paper He glanced at the
first page The middle column was devoted to a really capitally written
account of the proceedings at Bow Street consequent upon the arrest
of six men who it was alleged had caused a crowd to collect to the
disturbance of the peace by parading the Strand in the undress of Zulu
warriors shouting in unison the words Wah Wah Wah Buy Squibs

                                   

Young Mr Petheram greeted Roland with a joyous enthusiasm which the
hound Argus on the return of Ulysses might have equalled but could
scarcely have surpassed

It seemed to be Mr Petherams considered opinion that God was in His
Heaven and all was right with the world Rolands attempts to correct
this belief fell on deaf ears

Have I seen the advertisements he cried echoing his editors first
question Ive seen nothing else

There said Mr Petheram proudly

It cant go on

Yes it can Dont you worry I know theyre arrested as fast as we
send them out but bless you the supplys endless Ever since the
Revue boom started and actors were expected to do six different parts in
seven minutes there are platoons of musichall pros hanging about
the Strand ready to take on any sort of job you offer them I have a
special staff flushing the Bodegas These fellows love it Its meat and
drink to them to be right in the public eye like that Makes them feel
ten years younger Its wonderful the talent knocking about Those
Zulus used to have a steady job as the Six Brothers Biff Society
Contortionists The Revue craze killed them professionally They cried
like children when we took them on

By the way could you put through an expenses cheque before you go
The fines mount up a bit But dont you worry about that either Were
coining money Ill show you the returns in a minute I told you we
should turn the corner Turned it Blame me weve whizzed round it on
two wheels Have you had time to see the paper since you got back No
Then you havent seen our new Scandal PageWe Just Want to Know You
Know Its a corker and its sent the circulation up like a rocket
Everybody reads Squibs now I was hoping you would come back soon I
wanted to ask you about taking new offices Were a bit above this sort
of thing now

Roland meanwhile was reading with horrified eyes the alleged corking
Scandal Page It seemed to him without exception the most frightful
production he had ever seen It appalled him

This is awful he moaned We shall have a hundred libel actions

Oh no thats all right Its all fake stuff tho the public doesnt
know it If you stuck to real scandals you wouldnt get a par a week
A more moral set of blameless wasters than the blighters who constitute
modern society you never struck But it reads all right doesnt it Of
course every now and then one does hear something genuine and then it
goes in For instance have you ever heard of Percy Pook the bookie I
have got a real ripe thing in about Percy this week the absolute limpid
truth It will make him sit up a bit There just under your thumb

Roland removed his thumb and having read the paragraph in question
started as if he had removed it from a snake

But this is bound to mean a libel action he cried

Not a bit of it said Mr Petheram comfortably You dont know Percy
I wont bore you with his lifehistory but take it from me he doesnt
rush into a court of law from sheer love of it Youre safe enough

                                   

But it appeared that Mr Pook tho coy in the matter of cleansing his
scutcheon before a judge and jury was not wholly without weapons of
defense and offense Arriving at the office next day Roland found a
scene of desolation in the middle of which like Marius among the ruins
of Carthage sat Jimmy the vacantfaced office boy Jimmy was
reading an illustrated comic paper and appeared undisturbed by his
surroundings

Hes gorn he observed looking up as Roland entered

What do you mean Roland snapped at him Whos gone and where did he
go And besides that when you speak to your superiors you will rise and
stop chewing that infernal gum It gets on my nerves

Jimmy neither rose nor relinquished his gum He took his time and
answered

Mr Petheram A couple of fellers come in and went through and there
was a uproar inside there and presently out they come running and I
went in and there was Mr Petheram on the floor knocked silly and the
furniture all broke and now es gorn to orspital Those fellers ad
been putting im froo it proper concluded Jimmy with moody relish

Roland sat down weakly Jimmy his tale told resumed the study of his
illustrated paper Silence reigned in the offices of Squibs

It was broken by the arrival of Miss March Her exclamation of
astonishment at the sight of the wrecked room led to a repetition of
Jimmys story

She vanished on hearing the name of the hospital to which the stricken
editor had been removed and returned an hour later with flashing eyes
and a set jaw

Aubrey she saidit was news to Roland that Mr Petherams name was
Aubreyis very much knocked about but he is conscious and sitting up
and taking nourishment

Thats good

In a spoon only

Ah said Roland

The doctor says he will not be out for a week Aubrey is certain it was
that horrible bookmakers men who did it but of course he can prove
nothing But his last words to me were Slip it into Percy again this
week He has given me one or two things to mention I dont understand
them but Aubrey says they will make him wild

Rolands flesh crept The idea of making Mr Pook any wilder than he
appeared to be at present horrified him Panic gave him strength and
he addressed Miss March who was looking more like a modern Joan of Arc
than anything else on earth firmly

Miss March he said I realize that this is a crisis and that we
must all do all that we can for the paper and I am ready to do anything
in reasonbut I will not slip it into Percy You have seen the effects
of slipping it into Percy What he or his minions will do if we repeat
the process I do not care to think

You are afraid

Yes said Roland simply

Miss March turned on her heel It was plain that she regarded him as a
worm Roland did not like being thought a worm but it was infinitely
better than being regarded as an interesting case by the housesurgeon
of a hospital He belonged to the school of thought which holds that it
is better that people should say of you There he goes than that they
should say How peaceful he looks

Stress of work prevented further conversation It was a revelation to
Roland the vigor and energy with which Miss March threw herself into
the breach As a matter of fact so tremendous had been the labors of
the departed Mr Petheram that her work was more apparent than real
Thanks to Mr Petheram there was a sufficient supply of material in
hand to enable Squibs to run a fortnight on its own momentum Roland
however did not know this and with a view to doing what little he
could to help he informed Miss March that he would write the Scandal
Page It must be added that the offer was due quite as much to prudence
as to chivalry Roland simply did not dare to trust her with the Scandal
Page In her present mood it was not safe To slip it into Percy would
he felt be with her the work of a moment

                                   

Literary composition had never been Rolands forte He sat and stared at
the white paper and chewed the pencil which should have been marring its
whiteness with stinging paragraphs No sort of idea came to him

His brow grew damp What sort of peopleexcept bookmakersdid things
you could write scandal about As far as he could ascertain nobody

He picked up the morning paper The name Windlebird  caught his eye
A kind of pleasant melancholy came over him as he read the paragraph
How long ago it seemed since he had met that genial financier The
paragraph was not particularly interesting It gave a brief account of
some large deal which Mr Windlebird was negotiating Roland did not
understand a word of it but it gave him an idea

 He is a character in the Second Episode a fraudulent financier

Mr Windlebirds financial standing he knew was above suspicion Mr
Windlebird had made that clear to him during his visit There could be
no possibility of offending Mr Windlebird by a paragraph or two about
the manners and customs of financiers Phrases which his kindly host had
used during his visit came back to him and with them inspiration

Within five minutes he had compiled the following

    WE JUST WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW

    WHO is the eminent financier at present engaged upon one of his
    biggest deals

    WHETHER the public would not be welladvised to look a little
    closer into it before investing their money

    IF it is not a fact that this gentleman has bought a firstclass
    ticket to the Argentine in case of accidents

    WHETHER he may not have to use it at any moment

After that it was easy Ideas came with a rush By the end of an hour
he had completed a Scandal Page of which Mr Petheram himself might have
been proud without a suggestion of slipping it into Percy He felt that
he could go to Mr Pook and say Percy on your honor as a British
bookmaker have I slipped it into you in any way whatsoever And Mr
Pook would be compelled to reply You have not

Miss March read the proofs of the page and sniffed But Miss Marchs
blood was up and she would have sniffed at anything not directly
hostile to Mr Pook

                                   

A week later Roland sat in the office of Squibs reading a letter It
had been sent from No A Breams Buildings EC but from Rolands
point of view it might have come direct from heaven for its contents
signed by Harrison Harrison Harrison  Harrison Solicitors were to
the effect that a client of theirs had instructed them to approach him
with a view to purchasing the paper He would not find their client
disposed to haggle over terms so hoped Messrs Harrison Harrison
Harrison  Harrison in the event of Roland being willing to sell they
could speedily bring matters to a satisfactory conclusion

Any conclusion which had left him free of Squibs without actual
pecuniary loss would have been satisfactory to Roland He had conceived
a loathing for his property which not even its steadily increasing sales
could mitigate He was around at Messrs Harrisons office as soon as a
swift taxi could take him there The lawyers were for spinning the thing
out with guarded remarks and cautious preambles but Rolands methods of
doing business were always rapid

This chap he said this fellow who wants to buy Squibs whatll he
give

That began one of the Harrisons ponderously would of course
largely depend

Ill take five thousand Lock stock and barrel including the present
staff an even five thousand Hows that

Five thousand is a large

Take it or leave it

My dear sir you hold a pistol to our heads However I think that our
client might consent to the sum you mention

Good Well directly I get his check the things his By the way who
is your client

Mr Harrison coughed

His name he said will be familiar to you He is the eminent
financier Mr Geoffrey Windlebird





THE DIVERTING EPISODE OF THE EXILED MONARCH

Fifth of a Series of Six Stories First published in Pictorial Review
September 


The caoutchouc was drawing all London Slightly more indecent than the
Salome dance a shade less reticent than ragtime it had driven the
tango out of existence Nor indeed did anybody actually caoutchouc
for the national dance of Paranoya contained three hundred and
fifteen recognized steps but everybody tried to A new revue Hullo
Caoutchouc had been produced with success And the pioneer of the
dance the peerless Maraquita a native Paranoyan still performed it
nightly at the musichall where she had first broken loose

The caoutchouc fascinated Roland Bleke Maraquita fascinated him more
Of all the women to whom he had lost his heart at first sight Maraquita
had made the firmest impression upon him She was what is sometimes
called a fine woman

She had large flashing eyes the physique of a Rugby International
forward and the agility of a cat on hot bricks

There is a period of about fifty steps somewhere in the middle of the
three hundred and fifteen where the patient abandoning the comparative
decorum of the earlier movements whizzes about till she looks like a
salmoncolored whirlwind

That was the bit that hit Roland

Night after night he sat in his stagebox goggling at Maraquita and
applauding wildly

One night an attendant came to his box

Excuse me sir but are you Mr Roland Bleke The Senorita Maraquita
wishes to speak to you

He held open the door of the box The possibility of refusal did not
appear to occur to him Behind the scenes at that theater it was
generally recognized that when the Peerless One wanted a thing she got
itquick

They were alone

With no protective footlights between himself and her Roland came to
the conclusion that he had made a mistake It was not that she was any
less beautiful at the very close quarters imposed by the limits of
the dressingroom but he felt that in falling in love with her he had
undertaken a contract a little too large for one of his quiet diffident
nature It crossed his mind that the sort of woman he really liked was
the rather small drooping type Dynamite would not have made Maraquita
droop

For perhaps a minute and a half Maraquita fixed her compelling eyes on
his without uttering a word Then she broke a painful silence with this
leading question

You love me hein

Roland nodded feebly

When men make love to me I send them awayso

She waved her hand toward the door and Roland began to feel almost
cheerful again He was to be dismissed with a caution after all The
woman had a fine forgiving nature

But not you

Not me

No not you You are the man I have been waiting for I read about you
in the paper Senor Bleke I see your picture in the Daily Mirror I
say to myself What a man

Those picturepaper photographs always make one look rather weird
 mumbled Roland

I see you night after night in your box Poof I love you

Thanks awfully bleated Roland

You would do anything for my sake hein I knew you were that kind
of man directly I see you No she added as Roland writhed uneasily
in his chair do not embrace me Later yes but now no Not till the
Great Day

What the Great Day might be Roland could not even faintly conjecture He
could only hope that it would also be a remote one

And now said the Senorita throwing a cloak about her shoulders you
come away with me to my house My friends are there awaiting us They
will be glad and proud to meet you

                                   

After his first inspection of the house and the friends Roland came to
the conclusion that he preferred Maraquitas room to her company The
former was large and airy the latter with one exception small and
hairy

The exception Maraquita addressed as Bombito He was a conspicuous
figure He was one of those outsize hastylooking men One suspected
him of carrying lethal weapons

Maraquita presented Roland to the company The native speech of Paranoya
sounded like shorthand with a blend of Spanish An expert could
evidently squeeze a good deal of it into a minute Its effect on the
company was good They were manifestly soothed Even Bombito

Introductions in detail then took place This time for Rolands
benefit Maraquita spoke in English and he learned that most of those
present were marquises Before him so he gathered from Maraquita stood
the very flower of Paranoyas aristocracy driven from their native land
by the Infamy of  Roland was too polite to inquire what on earth
the Infamy of  might be but its mention had a marked effect on the
company Some scowled others uttered deepthroated oaths Bombito
did both Before supper to which they presently sat down was over
however Roland knew a good deal about Paranoya and its history The
conversation conducted by Maraquitato a ceaseless bouche pleine
accompaniment from her friendsbore exclusively upon the subject

Paranoya had it appeared existed fairly peacefully for centuries under
the rule of the Alejandro dynasty Then in the reign of Alejandro the
Thirteenth disaffection had begun to spread culminating in the Infamy
of  which Roland had at last discovered was nothing less than the
abolition of the monarchy and the installation of a republic

Since  the one thing for which they had lived besides the
caoutchouc was to see the monarchy restored and their beloved Alejandro
the Thirteenth back on his throne Their efforts toward this end
had been untiring and were at last showing signs of bearing fruit
Paranoya Maraquita assured Roland was honeycombed with intrigue The
army was disaffected the people anxious for a return to the old order
of things

A more propitious moment for striking the decisive blow was never likely
to arrive The question was purely one of funds

At the mention of the word funds Roland who had become thoroughly
bored with the lecture on Paranoyan history sat up and took notice
He had an instinctive feeling that he was about to be called upon for
a subscription to the cause of the distressful countrys freedom
Especially by Bombito

He was right A moment later Maraquita began to make a speech

She spoke in Paranoyan and Roland could not follow her but he gathered
that it somehow had reference to himself

As at the end of it the entire company rose to their feet and extended
their glasses toward him with a mighty shout he assumed that Maraquita
had been proposing his health

They say To the liberator of Paranoya kindly translated the
Peerless One You must excuse said Maraquita tolerantly as a bevy
of patriots surrounded Roland and kissed him on the cheek They are so
grateful to the savior of our country I myself would kiss you were it
not that I have sworn that no mans lips shall touch mine till the royal
standard floats once more above the palace of Paranoya But that will be
soon very soon she went on With you on our side we can not fail

What did the woman mean Roland asked himself wildly Did she labor
under the distressing delusion that he proposed to shed his blood on
behalf of a deposed monarch to whom he had never been introduced

Maraquitas next remarks made the matter clear

I have told them she said that you love me that you are willing
to risk everything for my sake I have promised them that you the
rich Senor Bleke will supply the funds for the revolution Once more
comrades To the Savior of Paranoya

Roland tried his hardest to catch the infection of this patriotic
enthusiasm but somehow he could not do it Base sordid mercenary
speculations would intrude themselves About how much was a good
wellfurnished revolution likely to cost As delicately as he could he
put the question to Maraquita

She said Poof The cost La la Which was all very well but hardly
satisfactory as a business chat However that was all Roland could get
out of her

                                   

The next few days passed for Roland in a sort of dream It was the kind
of dream which it is not easy to distinguish from a nightmare

Maraquitas reticence at the supperparty on the subject of details
connected with the financial side of revolutions entirely disappeared
She now talked nothing but figures and from the confused mass which
she presented to him Roland was able to gather that in financing
the restoration of royalty in Paranoya he would indeed be risking
everything for her sake

In the matter of revolutions Maraquita was no niggard She knew how the
thing should be donewell or not at all There would be so much for
rifles machineguns and what not and there would be so much for the
expense of smuggling them into the country Then there would be so much
to be laid out in corrupting the republican army Roland brightened a
little when they came to this item As the standing army of Paranoya
amounted to twenty thousand men and as it seemed possible to corrupt
it thoroughly at a cost of about thirty shillings a head the obvious
course to Rolands way of thinking was to concentrate on this side of
the question and avoid unnecessary bloodshed

It appeared however that Maraquita did not want to avoid bloodshed
that she rather liked bloodshed that the leaders of the revolution
would be disappointed if there were no bloodshed Especially Bombito
Unless she pointed out there was a certain amount of carnage looting
and so on the revolution would not achieve a popular success True the
beloved Alejandro might be restored but he would sit upon a throne
that was insecure unless the coronation festivities took a bloodthirsty
turn By all means said Maraquita corrupt the army but not at the
risk of making the affair tame and unpopular Paranoya was an emotional
country and liked its revolutions with a bit of zip to them

It was about ten days after he had definitely cast in his lot with the
revolutionary party that Roland was made aware that these things were a
little more complex than he had imagined He had reconciled himself to
the financial outlay It had been difficult but he had done it That
his person as well as his purse would be placed in peril he had not
foreseen

The fact was borne in upon him at the end of the second week by the
arrival of the deputation

It blew in from the street just as he was enjoying his afterdinner
cigar

It consisted of three men one long and suave the other two short
stout and silent They all had the sallow complexion and undue
hairiness which he had come by this time to associate with the native of
Paranoya

For a moment he mistook them for a drove of exiled noblemen whom he
had not had the pleasure of meeting at the supperparty and he waited
resignedly for them to make night hideous with the royal anthem He
poised himself on his toes the more readily to spring aside if they
should try to kiss him on the cheek

Mr Bleke said the long man

His companions drifted toward the cigarbox which stood open on the
table and looked at it wistfully

Long live the monarchy said Roland wearily He had gathered in the
course of his dealings with the exiled ones that this remark generally
went well

On the present occasion it elicited no outburst of cheering On the
contrary the long man frowned and his two companions helped themselves
to a handful of cigars apiece with a marked moodiness

Death to the monarchy corrected the long man coldly And he added
with a wealth of meaning in his voice to all who meddle in the affairs
of our beloved country and seek to do it harm

I dont know what you mean said Roland

Yes Senor Bleke you do know what I mean I mean that you will be
well advised to abandon the schemes which you are hatching with the
malcontents who would do my beloved land an injury

The conversation was growing awkward Roland had got so into the habit
of taking it for granted that every Paranoyan he met must of necessity
be a devotee of the beloved Alejandro that it came as a shock to him
to realize that there were those who objected to his restoration to
the throne Till now he had looked on the enemy as something in the
abstract It had not struck him that the people for whose correction
he was buying all these rifles and machineguns were individuals with a
lively distaste for having their blood shed

Senor Bleke resumed the speaker frowning at one of his companions
whose hand was hovering above the bottle of liqueur brandy you are a
man of sense You know what is safe and what is not safe Believe me
this scheme of yours is not safe You have been led away but there
is still time to withdraw Do so and all is well Do not so and your
blood be upon your own head

My blood gasped Roland

The speaker bowed

That is all he said We merely came to give the warning Ah Senor
Bleke do not be rash You think that here in this great London of
yours you are safe You look at the policeman upon the corner of the
road and you say to yourself I am safe Believe me not at all so is
it but much the opposite We have ways by which it is of no account the
policeman on the corner of the road That is all Senor Bleke We wish
you a good night

The deputation withdrew

Maraquita informed of the incident snapped her fingers and said
Poof It sometimes struck Roland that she would be more real help in a
difficult situation if she could get out of the habit of saying Poof

It is nothing she said

No said Roland

We easily outtrick them isnt it You make a will leaving your money
to the Cause and then where are they hein

It was one way of looking at it but it brought little balm to Roland
He said so Maraquita scanned his face keenly

You are not weakening Roland she said You would not betray us
now

Well of course I dont know about betraying you know but still
What I mean is

Maraquitas eyes seemed to shoot forth two flames

Take care she cried With me it is nothing for I know that your
heart is with Paranoya But if the others once had cause to suspect
that your resolve was failingah If Bombito

Roland took her point He had forgotten Bombito for the moment

For goodness sake he said hastily dont go saying anything to
Bombito to give him the idea that Im trying to back out Of course you
can rely on me and all that Thats all right

Maraquitas gaze softened She raised her glassthey were lunching at
the timeand put it to her lips

To the Savior of Paranoya she said

Beware whispered a voice in Rolands ear

He turned with a start A waiter was standing behind him a small dark
hairy man He was looking into the middle distance with the abstracted
air which waiters cultivate

Roland stared at him but he did not move

That evening returning to his flat Roland was paralyzed by the sight
of the word Beware scrawled across the mirror in his bedroom It had
apparently been done with a diamond He rang the bell

Sir said the competent valet Competent valets are in attendance at
each of these flatsAdvt

Has any one been here since I left

Yes sir A foreignlooking gentleman called He said he knew you sir
I showed him into your room

The same night well on in the small hours the telephone rang Roland
dragged himself out of bed

Hullo

Is that Senor Bleke

Yes What is it

Beware

Things were becoming intolerable Roland had a certain amount of
nerve but not enough to enable him to bear up against this sinister
persecution Yet what could he do Suppose he did beware to the extent
of withdrawing his support from the royalist movement what then
Bombito If ever there was a toad under the harrow he was that toad
And all because a perfectly respectful admiration for the caoutchouc
had led him to occupy a stagebox several nights in succession at the
theater where the peerless Maraquita tied herself into knots

                                   

There was an air of unusual excitement in Maraquitas manner at their
next meeting

We have been in communication with Him she whispered He will
receive you He will give an audience to the Savior of Paranoya

Eh Who will

Our beloved Alejandro He wishes to see his faithful servant We are to
go to him at once

Where

At his own house He will receive you in person

Such was the quality of the emotions through which he had been passing
of late that Roland felt but a faint interest at the prospect of
meeting face to face a genuineif exiledmonarch The thought did flit
through his mind that they would sit up a bit in old Finebergs office
if they could hear of it but it brought him little consolation

The cab drew up at a gloomylooking house in a fashionable square
Roland rang the doorbell There seemed a certain element of the prosaic
in the action He wondered what he should say to the butler

There was however no need for words The door opened and they were
ushered in without parley A butler and two footmen showed them into a
luxuriously furnished anteroom Roland entered with two thoughts
running in his mind The first was that the beloved Alejandro had got an
uncommonly snug crib the second that this was exactly like going to see
the dentist

Presently the squad of retainers returned the butler leading

His Majesty will receive Mr Bleke

Roland followed him with tottering knees

His Majesty King Alejandro the Thirteenth on the retired list was a
geniallooking man of middle age comfortably stout about the middle
and a little bald as to the forehead He might have been a prosperous
stockbroker Roland felt more at his ease at the very sight of him

Sit down Mr Bleke said His Majesty as the door closed I have
been wanting to see you for some time

Roland had nothing to say He was regaining his composure but he had a
long way to go yet before he could feel thoroughly at home

King Alejandro produced a cigaretcase and offered it to Roland
who shook his head speechlessly The King lit a cigaret and smoked
thoughtfully for a while

You know Mr Bleke he said at last this must stop It really must
I mean your devoted efforts on my behalf

Roland gaped at him

You are a very young man I had expected to see some one much older
Your youth gives me the impression that you have gone into this affair
from a spirit of adventure I can assure you that you have nothing to
gain commercially by interfering with my late kingdom I hope before
we part that I can persuade you to abandon your idea of financing this
movement to restore me to the throne

I dont understanderyour majesty

I will explain Please treat what I shall say as strictly confidential
You must know Mr Bleke that these attempts to reestablish me as a
reigning monarch in Paranoya are frankly the curse of an otherwise
very pleasant existence You look surprized My dear sir do you know
Paranoya Have you ever been there Have you the remotest idea what sort
of life a King of Paranoya leads I have tried it and I can assure
you that a coalheaver is happy by comparison In the first place the
climate of the country is abominable I always had a cold in the head
Secondly there is a small but energetic section of the populace whose
sole recreation it seems to be to use their monarch as a target for
bombs They are not very good bombs it is true but one in say ten
explodes and even an occasional bomb is unpleasant if you are the
target

Finally I am much too fond of your delightful country to wish to leave
it I was educated in EnglandI am a Magdalene College manand I have
the greatest horror of ever being compelled to leave it My present life
suits me exactly That is all I wished to say Mr Bleke For both our
sakes for the sake of my comfort and your purse abandon this scheme of
yours

                                   

Roland walked home thoughtfully Maraquita had left the royal residence
long before he had finished the whiskyandsoda which the genial monarch
had pressed upon him As he walked the futility of his situation came
home to him more and more Whatever he did he was bound to displease
somebody and these Paranoyans were so confoundedly impulsive when they
were vexed

For two days he avoided Maraquita On the third with something of the
instinct which draws the murderer to the spot where he has buried the
body he called at her house

She was not present but otherwise there was a full gathering There
were the marquises there were the counts there was Bombito

He looked unhappily round the crowd

Somebody gave him a glass of champagne He raised it

To the revolution he said mechanically

There was a silenceit seemed to Roland an awkward silence As if he
had said something improper the marquises and counts began to drift
from the room till only Bombito was left Roland regarded him with some
apprehension He was looking larger and more unusual than ever

But tonight apparently Bombito was in genial mood He came forward
and slapped Roland on the shoulder And then the remarkable fact came to
light that Bombito spoke English or a sort of English

My old chap he said I would have a speech with you

He slapped Roland again on the shoulder

The others they say Break it with Senor Bleke gently Maraquita say
Break it with Senor Bleke gently So I break it with you gently

He dealt Roland a third stupendous punch Whatever was to be broken
gently it was plain to Roland that it was not himself And suddenly
there came to him a sort of intuition that told him that Bombito was
nervous

After all you have done for us Senor Bleke we shall seem to you
ungrateful bounders but what is it Yes No I shouldnt wonder
perhaps The whole fact is that there has been political crisis in
Paranoya Upset Applecart Yes You follow No The Ministry have
beenwhat do you sayput through it Expelled Broken up No more
ministry New ministry wanted To conciliate royalist party that is
the cry So deputation of leading persons mighty good chaps prominent
merchants and that sort of bounder call upon us They offer me to be
President See No Yes Thats right I am ambitious blighter Senor
Bleke What about it no I accept I am new President of Paranoya So
no need for your kind assistance Royalist revolution up the spout No
more royalist revolution

The wave of relief which swept over Roland ebbed sufficiently after an
interval to enable him to think of some one but himself He was not fond
of Maraquita but he had a tender heart and this he felt would kill
the poor girl

But Maraquita

Thats all right splendid old chap No need to worry about Maraquita
stout old boy Where the husband goes so does the wife go As you say
whither thou goes will I follow No

But I dont understand Maraquita is not your wife

Why certainly good old heart What else

Have you been married to her all the time

Why certainly good dear boy

The room swam before Rolands eyes There was no room in his mind
for meditations on the perfidy of woman He groped forward and found
Bombitos hand

By Jove he said thickly as he wrung it again and again I knew you
were a good sort the first time I saw you Have a drink or something
Have a cigar or something Have something anyway and sit down and tell
me all about it





THE EPISODE OF THE HIRED PAST

Final Story of the Series First published in Pictorial Review
October 


What do you meanyou cant marry him after all After all what Why
cant you marry him You are perfectly childish

Lord Evenwoods gentle voice which had in its time lulled the House
of Peers to slumber more often than any voice ever heard in the
Gilded Chamber had in it a note of unwonted but quite justifiable
irritation If there was one thing more than another that Lord Evenwood
disliked it was any interference with arrangements already made

The man he continued is not unsightly The man is not conspicuously
vulgar The man does not eat peas with his knife The man pronounces his
aitches with meticulous care and accuracy The man moreover is worth
rather more than a quarter of a million pounds I repeat you are
childish

Yes I know hes a very decent little chap Father said Lady Eva
Its not that at all

I should be gratified then to hear what in your opinion it is

Well do you think I could be happy with him

Lady Kimbuck gave tongue She was Lord Evenwoods sister She spent a
very happy widowhood interfering in the affairs of the various branches
of her family

Were not asking you to be happy You have such odd ideas of happiness
Your idea of happiness is to be married to your cousin Gerry whose only
visible means of support so far as I can gather is the four hundred
a year which he draws as a member for a constituency which has every
intention of throwing him out at the next election

Lady Eva blushed Lady Kimbucks faculty for nosing out the secrets of
her family had made her justly disliked from the Hebrides to Southern
Cornwall

Young ORion is not to be thought of said Lord Evenwood firmly Not
for an instant Apart from anything else his politics are all
wrong Moreover you are engaged to this Mr Bleke It is a sacred
responsibility not lightly to be evaded You can not pledge your
word one day to enter upon the most solemn contract known toahthe
civilized world and break it the next It is not fair to the man It is
not fair to me You know that all I live for is to see you comfortably
settled If I could myself do anything for you the matter would be
different But these abominable landtaxes and Blowickespecially
Blowickno no its out of the question You will be very sorry if you
do anything foolish I can assure you that Roland Blekes are not to be
foundahon every bush Men are extremely shy of marrying nowadays

Especially said Lady Kimbuck into a family like ours What with
Blowicks scandal and that shocking business of your grandfather
and the circuswoman to say nothing of your poor fathers trouble in


Thank you Sophia interrupted Lord Evenwood hurriedly It is
unnecessary to go into all that now Suffice it that there are adequate
reasons apart from all moral obligations why Eva should not break her
word to Mr Bleke

Lady Kimbucks encyclopedic grip of the family annals was a source of
the utmost discomfort to her relatives It was known that more than one
firm of publishers had made her tempting offers for her reminiscences
and the family looked on like nervous spectators at a battle while
Cupidity fought its ceaseless fight with Laziness for the Evenwood
family had at various times and in various ways stimulated the
circulation of the evening papers Most of them were living down
something and it was Lady Kimbucks habit when thwarted in her
lightest whim to retire to her boudoir and announce that she was not
to be disturbed as she was at last making a start on her book Abject
surrender followed on the instant

At this point in the discussion she folded up her crochetwork and
rose

It is absolutely necessary for you my dear to make a good match or
you will all be ruined I of course can always support my declining
years with literary work but

Lady Eva groaned Against this last argument there was no appeal

Lady Kimbuck patted her affectionately on the shoulder

There run along now she said I daresay youve got a headache or
something that made you say a lot of foolish things you didnt mean
Go down to the drawingroom I expect Mr Bleke is waiting there to say
goodnight to you I am sure he must be getting quite impatient

Down in the drawingroom Roland Bleke was hoping against hope that Lady
Evas prolonged absence might be due to the fact that she had gone to
bed with a headache and that he might escape the nightly interview
which he so dreaded

Reviewing his career as he sat there Roland came to the conclusion
that women had the knack of affecting him with a form of temporary
insanity They temporarily changed his whole nature They made him feel
for a brief while that he was a dashing young man capable of the
highest flights of love It was only later that the reaction came and he
realized that he was nothing of the sort

At heart he was afraid of women and in the entire list of the women of
whom he had been afraid he could not find one who had terrified him so
much as Lady Eva Blyton

Other womennotably Maraquita now happily helping to direct the
destinies of Paranoyahad frightened him by their individuality Lady
Eva frightened him both by her individuality and the atmosphere of
aristocratic exclusiveness which she conveyed He had no idea whatever
of what was the proper procedure for a man engaged to the daughter of
an earl Daughters of earls had been to him till now mere names in the
society columns of the morning paper The very rules of the game were
beyond him He felt like a confirmed Association footballer suddenly
called upon to play in an International Rugby match

All along from the very moment whento his unbounded astonishmentshe
had accepted him he had known that he was making a mistake but he
never realized it with such painful clearness as he did this evening
He was filled with a sort of blind terror He cursed the fate which had
taken him to the CharityBazaar at which he had first come under the
notice of Lady Kimbuck The fatuous snobbishness which had made him leap
at her invitation to spend a few days at Evenwood Towers he regretted
but for that he blamed himself less Further acquaintance with Lady
Kimbuck had convinced him that if she had wanted him she would have got
him somehow whether he had accepted or refused

What he really blamed himself for was his mad proposal There had been
no need for it True Lady Eva had created a riot of burning emotions in
his breast from the moment they met but he should have had the sense to
realize that she was not the right mate for him even tho he might have
a quarter of a million tucked away in giltedged securities Their lives
could not possibly mix He was a commonplace young man with a fondness
for the pleasures of the people He liked cheap papers picturepalaces
and Association football Merely to think of Association football in
connection with her was enough to make the folly of his conduct
clear He ought to have been content to worship her from afar as some
inaccessible goddess

A light step outside the door made his heart stop beating

Ive just looked in to say good night MrerRoland she said
holding out her hand Do excuse me Ive got such a headache

Oh yes rather Im awfully sorry

If there was one person in the world Roland despised and hated at that
moment it was himself

Are you going out with the guns tomorrow asked Lady Eva languidly

Oh yes rather I mean no Im afraid I dont shoot

The back of his neck began to glow He had no illusions about himself
He was the biggest ass in Christendom

Perhaps youd like to play a round of golf then

Oh yes rather I mean no There it was again that awful phrase He
was certain he had not intended to utter it She must be thinking him a
perfect lunatic I dont play golf

They stood looking at each other for a moment It seemed to Roland that
her gaze was partly contemptuous partly pitying He longed to tell her
that tho she had happened to pick on his weak points in the realm of
sport there were things he could do An insane desire came upon him
to babble about his school football team Should he ask her to feel his
quite respectable biceps No

Never mind she said kindly I daresay we shall think of something
to amuse you

She held out her hand again He took it in his for the briefest possible
instant painfully conscious the while that his own hand was clammy from
the emotion through which he had been passing

Good night

Good night

Thank Heaven she was gone That let him out for another twelve hours at
least

A quarter of an hour later found Roland still sitting where she had
left him his head in his hands The groan of an overwrought soul
escaped him

I cant do it

He sprang to his feet

I wont do it

A smooth voice from behind him spoke

I think you are quite right sirif I may make the remark

Roland had hardly ever been so startled in his life In the first place
he was not aware of having uttered his thoughts aloud in the second he
had imagined that he was alone in the room And so a moment before he
had been

But the owner of the voice possessed among other qualities the
catlike faculty of entering a room perfectly noiselesslya fact which
had won for him in the course of a long career in the service of the
best families the flattering position of star witness in a number of
Englands raciest divorcecases

Mr Teal the butlerfor it was no less a celebrity who had broken in
on Rolands reveriewas a long thin man of a somewhat priestly cast of
countenance He lacked that air of reproving hauteur which many butlers
possess and it was for this reason that Roland had felt drawn to him
during the black days of his stay at Evenwood Towers Teal had been
uncommonly nice to him on the whole He had seemed to Roland stricken
by interviews with his host and Lady Kimbuck the only human thing in
the place

He liked Teal On the other hand Teal was certainly taking a liberty
He could if he so pleased tell Teal to go to the deuce Technically
he had the right to freeze Teal with a look

He did neither of these things He was feeling very lonely and very
forlorn in a strange and depressing world and Teals voice and manner
were soothing

Hearing you speak and seeing nobody else in the room went on the
butler I thought for a moment that you were addressing me

This was not true and Roland knew it was not true Instinct told him
that Teal knew that he knew it was not true but he did not press the
point

What do you meanyou think I am quite right he said You dont know
what I was thinking about

Teal smiled indulgently

On the contrary sir A child could have guessed it You have just
come to the decisionin my opinion a thoroughly sensible onethat your
engagement to her ladyship can not be allowed to go on You are quite
right sir It wont do

Personal magnetism covers a multitude of sins Roland was perfectly well
aware that he ought not to be standing here chatting over his and Lady
Evas intimate affairs with a butler but such was Teals magnetism that
he was quite unable to do the right thing and tell him to mind his own
business Teal you forget yourself would have covered the situation
Roland however was physically incapable of saying Teal you forget
yourself The bird knows all the time that he ought not to stand
talking to the snake but he is incapable of ending the conversation
Roland was conscious of a momentary wish that he was the sort of man who
could tell butlers that they forgot themselves But then that sort
of man would never be in this sort of trouble The Teal you forget
yourself type of man would be a firstclass shot a plus golfer and
would certainly consider himself extremely lucky to be engaged to Lady
Eva

The question is went on Mr Teal how are we to break it off

Roland felt that as he had sinned against all the decencies in allowing
the butler to discuss his affairs with him he might just as well go
the whole hog and allow the discussion to run its course And it was an
undeniable relief to talk about the infernal thing to some one

He nodded gloomily and committed himself Teal resumed his remarks with
the gusto of a fellowconspirator

Its not an easy thing to do gracefully sir believe me it isnt
And its got to be done gracefully or not at all You cant go to her
ladyship and say Its all off and so am I and catch the next train
for London The rupture must be of her ladyships making If some
fact some disgraceful information concerning you were to come to her
ladyships ears that would be a simple way out of the difficulty

He eyed Roland meditatively

If for instance you had ever been in jail sir

Well I havent

No offense intended sir Im sure I merely remembered that you had
made a great deal of money very quickly My experience of gentlemen who
have made a great deal of money very quickly is that they have generally
done their bit of time But of course if you Let me think Do you
drink sir

No

Mr Teal sighed Roland could not help feeling that he was disappointing
the old man a good deal

You do not I suppose chance to have a past asked Mr Teal not very
hopefully I use the word in its technical sense A deserted wife Some
poor creature you have treated shamefully

At the risk of sinking still further in the butlers esteem Roland was
compelled to answer in the negative

I was afraid not said Mr Teal shaking his head Thinking it all
over yesterday I said to myself Im afraid he wouldnt have one You
dont look like the sort of gentleman who had done much with his time

Thinking it over

Not on your account sir explained Mr Teal On the familys I
disapproved of this match from the first A man who has served a family
as long as I have had the honor of serving his lordships comes to
entertain a high regard for the family prestige And with no offense to
yourself sir this would not have done

Well it looks as if it would have to do said Roland gloomily I
cant see any way out of it

I can sir My niece at Aldershot

Mr Teal wagged his head at him with a kind of priestly archness

You can not have forgotten my niece at Aldershot

Roland stared at him dumbly It was like a line out of a melodrama He
feared first for his own then for the butlers sanity The latter was
smiling gently as one who sees light in a difficult situation

Ive never been at Aldershot in my life

For our purposes you have sir But Im afraid I am puzzling you Let
me explain Ive got a niece over at Aldershot who isnt much
good Shes not very particular I am sure she would do it for a
consideration

Do what

Be your Past sir I dont mind telling you that as a Past shes
had some experience looks the part too Shes a barmaid and you would
guess it the first time you saw her Dyed yellow hair sir he went on
with enthusiasm done all frizzy Just the sort of young person that a
young gentleman like yourself would have had a past with You couldnt
find a better if you tried for a twelvemonth

But I say

I suppose a hundred wouldnt hurt you

Well no I suppose not but

Then put the whole thing in my hands sir Ill ask leave off tomorrow
and pop over and see her Ill arrange for her to come here the day
after to see you Leave it all to me Tonight you must write the
letters

Letters

Naturally there would be letters sir It is an inseparable feature of
these cases

Do you mean that I have got to write to her But I shouldnt know what
to say Ive never seen her

That will be quite all right sir if you place yourself in my hands I
will come to your room after everybodys gone to bed and help you write
those letters You have some notepaper with your own address on it
Then it will all be perfectly simple

When some hours later he read over the ten or twelve exceedingly
passionate epistles which with the butlers assistance he had
succeeded in writing to Miss Maud Chilvers Roland came to the
conclusion that there must have been a time when Mr Teal was a good
deal less respectable than he appeared to be at present Byronic was
the only adjective applicable to his collaborators style of amatory
composition In every letter there were passages against which Roland
had felt compelled to make a modest protest

A thousand kisses on your lovely rosebud of a mouth Dont you think
that is a little too warmly colored And I am languishing for the
pressure of your ivory arms about my neck and the sweep of your silken
hair against my cheek What I mean iswell what about it you know

The phrases said Mr Teal not without a touch of displeasure to
which you take exception are taken bodily from correspondence which I
happened to have the advantage of perusing addressed by the late Lord
Evenwood to Animalcula Queen of the High Wire at Astleys Circus His
lordship I may add was considered an authority in these matters

Roland criticized no more He handed over the letters which at Mr
Teals direction he had headed with various dates covering roughly a
period of about two months antecedent to his arrival at the Towers

That Mr Teal explained will make your conduct definitely
unpardonable With this womans kisses hot upon your lipsMr Teal
was still slightly aglow with the fire of inspirationyou have the
effrontery to come here and offer yourself to her ladyship

With Rolands timid suggestion that it was perhaps a mistake to overdo
the atmosphere the butler found himself unable to agree

You cant make yourself out too bad If you dont pitch it hot and
strong her ladyship might quite likely forgive you Then where would
you be

Miss Maud Chilvers of Aldershot burst into Rolands life like one
of the shells of her native heath two days later at about five in the
afternoon

It was an entrance of which any stagemanager might have been proud
of having arranged The lighting the grouping the leadupall were
perfect The family had just finished tea in the long drawingroom
Lady Kimbuck was crocheting Lord Evenwood dozing Lady Eva reading and
Roland thinking A peaceful scene

A soft rippling murmur scarcely to be reckoned a snore had just
proceeded from Lord Evenwoods parted lips when the door opened and
Teal announced Miss Chilvers

Roland stiffened in his chair Now that the ghastly moment had come he
felt too petrified with fear even to act the little part in which he had
been diligently rehearsed by the obliging Mr Teal He simply sat and
did nothing

It was speedily made clear to him that Miss Chilvers would do all the
actual doing that was necessary The butler had drawn no false picture
of her personal appearance Dyed yellow hair done all frizzy was but one
fact of her manysided impossibilities In the serene surroundings of
the long drawingroom she looked more unspeakably not much good than
Roland had ever imagined her With such a leading lady his drama
could not fail of success He should have been pleased he was merely
appalled The thing might have a happy ending but while it lasted it
was going to be terrible

She had a flatteringly attentive reception Nobody failed to notice her
Lord Evenwood woke with a start and stared at her as if she had been
some ghost from his trouble of  Lady Evas face expressed sheer
amazement Lady Kimbuck laying down her crochetwork took one look at
the apparition and instantly decided that one of her numerous erring
relatives had been at it again Of all the persons in the room she
was possibly the only one completely cheerful She was used to these
situations and enjoyed them Her mind roaming into the past recalled
the night when her cousin Warminster had been pinked by a stiletto in
his own drawingroom by a lady from South America Happy days happy
days

Lord Evenwood had by this time come to the conclusion that the festive
Blowick must be responsible for this visitation He rose with dignity

To what are we he began

Miss Chilvers resolute young woman had no intention of standing there
while other people talked She shook her gleaming head and burst into
speech

Oh yes I know Ive no right to be coming walking in here among a lot
of perfect strangers at their teas but what I say is Rights right
and wrongs wrong all the world over and I may be poor but I have
my feelings No thank you I wont sit down Ive not come for the
weekend Ive come to say a few words and when Ive said them Ill go
and not before A lady friend of mine happened to be reading her Daily
Sketch the other day and she said Hullo hullo and passed it on to
me with her thumb on a picture which had under it that it was Lady Eva
Blyton who was engaged to be married to Mr Roland Bleke And when I
read that I said Hullo hullo too I give you my word And not being
able to travel at once owing to being prostrated with the shock I came
along today just to have a look at Mr Roland Blooming Bleke and ask
him if hes forgotten that he happens to be engaged to me Thats all I
know its the sort of thing that might slip any gentlemans mind but I
thought it might be worth mentioning So now

                                   

Roland perspiring in the shadows at the far end of the room felt that
Miss Chilvers was overdoing it There was no earthly need for all this
sort of thing Just a simple announcement of the engagement would have
been quite sufficient It was too obvious to him that his ally was
thoroughly enjoying herself She had the center of the stage and did
not intend lightly to relinquish it

My good girl said Lady Kimbuck talk less and prove more When did
Mr Bleke promise to marry you

Oh its all right Im not expecting you to believe my word Ive got
all the proofs youll want Heres his letters

Lady Kimbucks eyes gleamed She took the package eagerly She never
lost an opportunity of reading compromising letters She enjoyed them
as literature and there was never any knowing when they might come in
useful

Roland said Lady Eva quietly havent you anything to contribute to
this conversation

Miss Chilvers clutched at her bodice Cinema palaces were a passion with
her and she was up in the correct business

Is he here In this room

Roland slunk from the shadows

Mr Bleke said Lord Evenwood sternly who is this woman

Roland uttered a kind of strangled cough

Are these letters in your handwriting asked Lady Kimbuck almost
cordially She had seldom read better compromising letters in her life
and she was agreeably surprized that one whom she had always imagined a
colorless stick should have been capable of them

Roland nodded

Well its lucky youre rich said Lady Kimbuck philosophically What
are you asking for these she enquired of Miss Chilvers

Exactly said Lord Evenwood relieved Precisely Your sterling
common sense is admirable Sophia You place the whole matter at once on
a businesslike footing

Do you imagine for a moment began Miss Chilvers slowly

Yes said Lady Kimbuck How much

Miss Chilvers sobbed

If I have lost him for ever

Lady Eva rose

But you havent she said pleasantly I wouldnt dream of standing in
your way She drew a ring from her finger placed it on the table and
walked to the door I am not engaged to Mr Bleke she said as she
reached it

Roland never knew quite how he had got away from The Towers He had
confused memories in which the principals of the drawingroom scene
figured in various ways all unpleasant It was a portion of his life
on which he did not care to dwell Safely back in his flat however he
gradually recovered his normal spirits Indeed now that the tumult and
the shouting had so to speak died and he was free to take a broad
view of his position he felt distinctly happier than usual That Lady
Kimbuck had passed for ever from his life was enough in itself to make
for gaiety

                                   

He was humming blithely one morning as he opened his letters outside
the sky was blue and the sun shining It was good to be alive He opened
the first letter The sky was still blue the sun still shining

    Dear Sir it ran

    We have been instructed by our client Miss Maud Chilvers of the
    Goat and Compasses Aldershot to institute proceedings against
    you for Breach of Promise of Marriage In the event of your being
    desirous to avoid the expense and publicity of litigation we are
    instructed to say that Miss Chilvers would be prepared to accept
    the sum of ten thousand pounds in settlement of her claim against
    you We would further add that in support of her case our client
    has in her possession a number of letters written by yourself to
    her all of which bear strong prima facie evidence of the alleged
    promise to marry and she will be able in addition to call as
    witnesses in support of her case the Earl of Evenwood Lady
    Kimbuck and Lady Eva Blyton in whose presence at a recent
    date you acknowledged that you had promised to marry our client

    Trusting that we hear from you in the course of post
           We are dear Sir
                   Yours faithfully
                            Harrison Harrison Harrison  Harrison
