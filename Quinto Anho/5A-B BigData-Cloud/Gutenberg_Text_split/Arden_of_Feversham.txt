Considering the various and marvellous gifts displayed for the first
time on our stage by the great poet the great dramatist the strong
and subtle searcher of hearts the just and merciful judge and painter
of human passions who gave this tragedy to the newborn literature
of our drama  I cannot but finally take heart to say even in
the absence of all external or traditional testimony that it seems
to me not pardonable merely or permissible but simply logical and
reasonable to set down this poem a young mans work on the face of
it as the possible work of no mans youthful hand but Shakespeares

Mr A C SWINBURNE




PREFACE


Early Editions On rd April  The Tragedie of Arden of
Feversham and BlackwallA was entered on the Stationers Registers
to Edward White In the same year appeared The lamentable and true
Tragedie of M Arden of Feversham in Kent Who was most wickedlye
murdered by the meanes of his disloyall and wanton wyfe who for the
love she bare to one Mosbie hyred two desperat ruffins Blackwill
and Shakbag to kill him Wherin is shewed the great mallice and
discimulation of a wicked woman the unsatiable desire of filthie lust
and the shamefull end of all murderers Imprinted at London for Edward
White dwelling at the lyttle North dore of Paules Church at the signe
of the Gun  A second Quarto with the same title was printed
in  A third by Eliz Allde dwelling neere Christs Church
appeared in  The second and third Quartos are founded textually
upon the first and their variations are of no value The text of the
first Quarto is unusually good even when prose and verse are mixed
together although the printer has apparently no scientific knowledge
of the nature of metre

Footnote A A misprint for Blackwill


Place of the Play in the Elizabethan Drama Arden of Faversham
is the finest extant specimen of a kind of play which has been
classified as Domestic Tragedy A picturesque or sensational murder in
the sixteenth century was given to the public first in popular ballads
or pamphlets and afterwards if sufficiently notable in the more
serious Chronicle From the popular pamphlet or from the Chronicle
or from both together it found its way on to the stage Four of these
murderplays have come down to us and the titles of many others
They form a minor section of the Chronicle plays or Histories They did
not attain any very striking literary development owing perhaps to the
necessary bondage of the poet to his facts Arden of Faversham is a
remarkable instance of the possibilities of this class of play but it
is to be noted that the poet used the narrative of a Chronicler who
wrote twentyseven years after the date of the murder A Warning for
Fair Women and Yaringtons Two Tragedies in One are both inferior
to Arden though influenced by it The fourth murderplayThe
Yorkshire Tragedyis distinct from the other three in style and
method Several famous dramatists produced domestic tragedies but
none have survived A Late Murder of the Son upon the Mother in
which Ford and Webster collaborated must have been a notable piece of
work


Source of the Play On Sunday th February  Thomas
Ardern of Faversham gentleman was heynously murdered in his own
parlour about seven of the clock in the night by one Thomas Morsby a
taylor of London late servant to sir Edward North knight chancellor
of the augmentations fatherinlaw unto Alice Ardern wife of the
said Thomas Ardern Thomas Ardern was Mayor of Faversham in 
and his murder made such a stir that in  the first edition of
Holinsheds Chronicle devotes five pages pp  to an elaborate
account of it The chronicler begins thusAbout this time there was
at Faversham in Kent a Gentleman named Arden most cruelly murthered
and slain by the procurement of his own wife The which murder for
the horribleness thereof although otherwise it may seem to be but a
private matter and therefore as it were impertinent to this History
I have thought good to set it forth somewhat at large having the
instructions delivered to me by them that have used some diligence
to gather the true understanding of the circumstances Our first
quotation was from the Wardmote Book of Faversham and proves that
Holinsheds narrative is not minutely accurate The Wardmote Book
gives a curt account of the actual murder on the Sunday evening with
the names and fate of the culprits It tells us nothing of the previous
failures of these culprits which give to Holinsheds tale such a
terrible and dramatic interest We need not speculate on Holinsheds
sources No doubt there were many contemporary pamphlets and ballads
which recounted the murder We know only of The Complaint  of
Mistress Arden of Feversham preserved among the Roxburghe Ballads
and reprinted by Evans and in Miss De Vaynes Kentish Garland
But this is dated by Mr Bullen about  when the third Quarto
of the play appeared and was probably occasioned by that reissue
The important point to bear in mind is the excellence of Holinsheds
narrative To praise it adequately we must say that it is worthy of
the fine play founded upon it which probably had no other source
The play agrees always with Holinshed when Holinshed differs from the
Wardmote Book When the play differs from Holinshed it differs also
from the Wardmote Book To the dramatic instinct of the poet we must
ascribe his suppression of the fact that Arden winked at his wifes
infidelity Holinshed and the Wardmote Book both explicitly assert
this Franklin Ardens friend is also an invention of the dramatist


Author of the Play The three Quartos are all anonymous We
know of no other edition till  when Edward Jacob a Faversham
antiquary edited the first Quarto and boldly claimed the play for
Shakespeare Ludwig Tieck published in  an excellent German
translation accompanied by a discriminating statement of the case for
the Shakesperean authorship Delius editing the play in  agreed
with Tieck and was followed by the French translator Franois Victor
Hugo and more recently by Professor Mzires Owing to the supposed
Shakespearean authorship there have been at least three translations
into German one into French and one into Dutch In England opinion
has been more divided Henry TyrrellB Charles Knight and Mr
SwinburneC have supported the Shakespearean authorship Professor
WardD and J A Symonds incline to reject it Professor Saintsbury
considers that the only possible hypothesis on which it could be
admitted as Shakespeares would be that of an early experiment thrown
off while he was seeking his way in a direction where he found no
thoroughfareE Mr Bullen who edited a careful reprint of the first
Quarto in  suspects that Arden in its present state has been
retouched here and there by the masters hand The latest German
editors Warnke and Proescholt  are of opinion that Shakespeare
had nothing to do with Arden of Faversham

Footnote E History of Elizabethan Literature


The Question of Shakespeares Authorship The only reason for
ascribing the play to Shakespeare is its merit It seems incredible
that a drama so mature in its art should have been written in 
by a writer otherwise unknown to us In three directions the art of
the writer is mature First the character of the base coward Mosbie
and of the bourgeois Clytemnestra Alice Arden are drawn with an
insight delicacy and sustained power new to English literature in
 and not excelled till Shakespeare excelled them The picture of
Arden as a man fascinated and bewitched by his wife and by his fate
might match that of Mosbie and Alice if the artist had not blurred his
conception by the introduction of the jarring motives of avarice and
sacrilege But the poets aim is clear it is his own and it almost
succeeds Second the picturesque ferocity and grim humour of Black
Will and Shakebag are described with a firmness and ease and restraint
of style which critics have not sufficiently noted I can compare it
only with the Jack Cade scenes of the Contention and  Henry VI
The prose of our poet is excellent His humour has a clearly defined
character and style of its own The character of Michael so admired
by Mr Swinburne is as subtle and wellsustained as Mosbies or Alice
Ardens and it exhibits our poets special humorous gift This gift
excellent as it is seems to me very definitely not Shakespearean
But thirdly the terrifying use of signs and omens and of an almost
Shakespearean ironyeg Ardens words I am almost stifled with
this fogcombine to produce as the play proceeds an impressive sense
of the slow unerring tread of assassination balked but persevering
marching like a fate to its accomplishment But the special
excellencies of the play are all against Shakespeare having written
it by  As Mr Bullen insists the weak point in Mr Swinburnes
criticism is the phrase a young mans work This play is not a young
mans work The copiousness of the young man Shakespeares work is
the exact contrary of the deliberate anxious effort which marks the
style of Arden of Faversham except in the prose scenes In none of
Shakespeares plays can it be perceived that the poet has taken such
pains as the poet of Arden takes Unless Shakespeare wrote this play
as soon as he reached London and then for a year or two wrote nothing
else it is impossible to fit it into his work And if he wrote the
play as soon as he reached London and then took up the studies which
resulted in Venus and Adonis and Lucrece would he have written
Loves Labours Lost and Comedy of Errors on his way back to work
like Arden If Shakespeare wrote Arden it is the most interesting
fact in his literary development To suggest that Shakespeare revised
the play is to shirk the question Its excellence is in its warp and
woof not in its ornaments


Literature Mr Bullens Introduction is the best monograph on
the play Warnke and Proescholts Introduction should be consulted
but lacks the distinction of style and the critical insight of Mr
Bullens essay Excellent analyses and criticisms of the play are in
Charles Knights Doubtful Plays Pictorial Shakespere J A
Symonds Shaksperes Predecessors Alfred Mzires Prdcesseurs et
Contemporains de Shakspeare Mr Fleay in his Biographical Chronicle
of the English Drama  has suggested Kyd as the author of Arden

ARDEN OF FEVERSHAM




ACT I


A Room in Ardens House

Enter Arden and Franklin

Franklin Arden cheer up thy spirits and droop no more
My gracious Lord the Duke of Somerset
Hath freely given to thee and to thy heirs
By letters patents from his Majesty
All the lands of the Abbey of Feversham
Here are the deeds      He hands them
Sealed and subscribed with his name and the kings
Read them and leave this melancholy mood

Arden Franklin thy love prolongs my weary life
And but for thee how odious were this life      
That shows me nothing but torments my soul
And those foul objects that offend mine eyes
Which makes me wish that for this veil of heaven
The earth hung over my head and covered me
Loveletters pass twixt Mosbie and my wife
And they have privy meetings in the town
Nay on his finger did I spy the ring
Which at our marriageday the priest put on
Can any grief be half so great as this

Franklin Comfort thyself sweet friend it is not strange      
That women will be false and wavering

Arden Ay but to dote on such a one as he
Is monstrous Franklin and intolerable

Franklin Why what is he

Arden A botcher and no better at the first
Who by base brokage getting some small stock
Crept into service of a nobleman
And by his servile flattery and fawning
Is now become the steward of his house
And bravely jets it in his silken gown      

Franklin No nobleman will countenance such a peasant

Arden Yes the Lord Clifford he that loves not me
But through his favour let him not grow proud
For were he by the Lord Protector backed
He should not make me to be pointed at
I am by birth a gentleman of blood
And that injurious ribald that attempts
To violate my dear wifes chastity
For dear I hold her love as dear as heaven
Shall on the bed which he thinks to defile      
See his dissevered joints and sinews torn
Whilst on the planchers pants his weary body
Smeared in the channels of his lustful blood

Franklin Be patient gentle friend and learn of me
To ease thy grief and save her chastity
Intreat her fair sweet words are fittest engines
To race the flint walls of a womans breast
In any case be not too jealous
Nor make no question of her love to thee
But as securely presently take horse      
And lie with me at London all this term
For women when they may will not
But being kept back straight grow outrageous

Arden Though this abhors from reason yet Ill try it
And call her forth and presently take leave
How Alice

Here enters Alice

Alice Husband what mean you to get up so early
Summernights are short and yet you rise ere day
Had I been wake you had not risen so soon

Arden Sweet love thou knowest that we two Ovidlike      
Have often chid the morning when it gan to peep
And often wished that dark nights purblind steeds
Would pull her by the purple mantle back
And cast her in the ocean to her love
But this night sweet Alice thou hast killed my heart
I heard thee call on Mosbie in thy sleep

Alice Tis like I was asleep when I named him
For being awake he comes not in my thoughts

Arden Ay but you started up and suddenly
Instead of him caught me about the neck      

Alice Instead of him why who was there but you
And where but one is how can I mistake

Franklin Arden leave to urge her overfar

Arden Nay love there is no credit in a dream
Let it suffice I know thou lovest me well

Alice Now I remember whereupon it came
Had we no talk of Mosbie yesternight

Franklin Mistress Alice I heard you name him once or twice

Alice And thereof came it and therefore blame not me

Arden I know it did and therefore let it pass      
I must to London sweet Alice presently

Alice But tell me do you mean to stay there long

Arden No longer there till my affairs be done

Franklin He will not stay above a month at most

Alice A month ay me Sweet Arden come again
Within a day or two or else I die

Arden I cannot long be from thee gentle Alice
Whilst Michael fetch our horses from the field
Franklin and I will down unto the quay
For I have certain goods there to unload      
Meanwhile prepare our breakfast gentle Alice
For yet ere noon well take horse and away

      Exeunt Arden and Franklin

Alice Ere noon he means to take horse and away
Sweet news is this O that some airy spirit
Would in the shape and likeness of a horse
Gallop with Arden cross the Ocean
And throw him from his back into the waves
Sweet Mosbie is the man that hath my heart
And he usurps it having nought but this
That I am tied to him by marriage      
Love is a God and marriage is but words
And therefore Mosbies title is the best
Tush whether it be or no he shall be mine
In spite of him of Hymen and of rites

Here enters Adam of the Flowerdeluce

And here comes Adam of the Flowerdeluce
I hope he brings me tidings of my love
How now Adam what is the news with you
Be not afraid my husband is now from home

Adam He whom you wot of Mosbie Mistress Alice
Is come to town and sends you word by me      
In any case you may not visit him

Alice Not visit him

Adam No nor take no knowledge of his being here

Alice But tell me is he angry or displeased

Adam It should seem so for he is wondrous sad

Alice Were he as mad as raving Hercules
Ill see him I and were thy house of force
These hands of mine should race it to the ground
Unless that thou wouldst bring me to my love

Adam Nay and you be so impatient Ill be gone      

Alice Stay Adam stay thou wert wont to be my friend
Ask Mosbie how I have incurred his wrath
Bear him from me these pair of silver dice
With which we played for kisses many a time
And when I lost I won and so did he
Such winning and such losing Jove send me
And bid him if his love do not decline
To come this morning but along my door
And as a stranger but salute me there
This may he do without suspect or fear      

Adam Ill tell him what you say and so farewell

      Exit Adam

Alice Do and one day Ill make amends for all
I know he loves me well but dares not come
Because my husband is so jealous
And these my narrowprying neighbours blab
Hinder our meetings when we would confer
But if I live that block shall be removed
And Mosbie thou that comes to me by stealth
Shalt neither fear the biting speech of men
Nor Ardens looks as surely shall he die      
As I abhor him and love only thee

Here enters Michael

How now Michael whither are you going

Michael To fetch my masters nag
I hope youll think on me

Alice Ay but Michael see you keep your oath
And be as secret as you are resolute

Michael Ill see he shall not live above a week

Alice On that condition Michael heres my hand
None shall have Mosbies sister but thyself

Michael I understand the painter here hard by      
Hath made report that he and Sue is sure

Alice Theres no such matter Michael believe it not

Michael But he hath sent a dagger sticking in a heart
With a verse or two stolen from a painted cloth
The which I hear the wench keeps in her chest
Well let her keep it I shall find a fellow
That can both write and read and make rhyme too
And if I dowell I say no more
Ill send from London such a taunting letter
As she shall eat the heart he sent with salt      
And fling the dagger at the painters head

Alice What needs all this I say that Susans thine

Michael Why then I say that I will kill my master
Or anything that you will have me do

Alice But Michael see you do it cunningly

Michael Why say I should be took Ill neer confess
That you know anything and Susan being a maid
May beg me from the gallows of the sheriff

Alice Trust not to that Michael

Michael You cannot tell me I have seen it I      
But mistress tell her whether I live or die
Ill make her more worth than twenty painters can
For I will rid mine elder brother away
And then the farm of Bolton is mine own
Who would not venture upon house and land
When he may have it for a right down blow

Here enters Mosbie

Alice Yonder comes Mosbie Michael get thee gone
And let not him nor any know thy drifts

      Exit Michael

Mosbie my love

Mosbie Away I say and talk not to me now      

Alice A word or two sweet heart and then I will
Tis yet but early days thou needst not fear

Mosbie Where is your husband

Alice Tis now high water and he is at the quay

Mosbie There let him be henceforward know me not

Alice Is this the end of all thy solemn oaths
Is this the fruit thy reconcilement buds
Have I for this given thee so many favours
Incurred my husbands hate and out alas
Made shipwreck of mine honour for thy sake      
And dost thou say henceforward know me not
Remember when I lockd thee in my closet
What were thy words and mine did we not both
Decree to murder Arden in the night
The heavens can witness and the world can tell
Before I saw that falsehood look of thine
Fore I was tangled with thy ticing speech
Arden to me was dearer than my soul
And shall be still base peasant get thee gone
And boast not of thy conquest over me           
Gotten by witchcraft and mere sorcery
For what hast thou to countenance my love
Being descended of a noble house
And matched already with a gentleman
Whose servant thou mayst beand so farewell

Mosbie Ungentle and unkind Alice now I see
That which I ever feared and find too true
A womans love is as the lightningflame
Which even in bursting forth consumes itself
To try thy constancy have I been strange      
Would I had never tried but lived in hope

Alice What needst thou try me whom thou neer found false

Mosbie Yet pardon me for love is jealous

Alice So lists the sailor to the mermaids song
So looks the traveller to the basilisk
I am content for to be reconciled
And that I know will be mine overthrow

Mosbie Thine overthrow first let the world dissolve

Alice Nay Mosbie let me still enjoy thy love
And happen what will I am resolute           
My saving husband hoards up bags of gold
To make our children rich and now is he
Gone to unload the goods that shall be thine
And he and Franklin will to London straight

Mosbie To London Alice if thoult be ruled by me
Well make him sure enough for coming there

Alice Ah would we could

Mosbie I happened on a painter yesternight
The only cunning man of Christendom
For he can temper poison with his oil      
That whoso looks upon the work he draws
Shall with the beams that issue from his sight
Suck venom to his breast and slay himself
Sweet Alice he shall draw thy counterfeit
That Arden may by gazing on it perish

Alice Ay but Mosbie that is dangerous
For thou or I or any other else
Coming into the chamber where it hangs may die

Mosbie Ay but well have it covered with a cloth
And hung up in the study for himself      

Alice It may not be for when the pictures drawn
Arden I know will come and show it me

Mosbie Fear not well have that shall serve the turn
This is the painters house Ill call him forth

Alice But Mosbie Ill have no such picture I

Mosbie I pray thee leave it to my discretion
How Clarke

Here enters Clarke

Oh you are an honest man of your word you served me well

Clarke Why sir Ill do it for you at any time
Provided as you have given your word      
I may have Susan Mosbie to my wife
For as sharpwitted poets whose sweet verse
Make heavenly gods break off their nectar draughts
And lay their ears down to the lowly earth
Use humble promise to their sacred Muse
So we that are the poets favourites
Must have a love ay Love is the painters muse
That makes him frame a speaking countenance
A weeping eye that witnesses hearts grief
Then tell me Master Mosbie shall I have her      

Alice Tis pity but he should hell use her well

Mosbie Clarke heres my hand my sister shall be thine

Clarke Then brother to requite this courtesy
You shall command my life my skill and all

Alice Ah that thou couldst be secret

Mosbie Fear him not leave I have talked sufficient

Clarke You know not me that ask such questions
Let it suffice I know you love him well
And fain would have your husband made away
Wherein trust me you show a noble mind      
That rather than youll live with him you hate
Youll venture life and die with him you love
The like will I do for my Susans sake

Alice Yet nothing could inforce me to the deed
But Mosbies love Might I without control
Enjoy thee still then Arden should not die
But seeing I cannot therefore let him die

Mosbie Enough sweet Alice thy kind words makes me melt
Your trick of poisoned pictures we dislike
Some other poison would do better far      

Alice Ay such as might be put into his broth
And yet in taste not to be found at all

Clarke I know your mind and here I have it for you
Put but a dram of this into his drink
Or any kind of broth that he shall eat
And he shall die within an hour after

Alice As I am a gentlewoman Clarke next day
Thou and Susan shall be married

Mosbie And Ill make her dowry more than Ill talk of Clarke

Clarke Yonders your husband Mosbie Ill be gone      

Here enters Arden and Franklin

Alice In good time see where my husband comes
Master Mosbie ask him the question yourself

      Exit Clarke

Mosbie Master Arden being at London yesternight
The Abbey lands whereof you are now possessed
Were offered me on some occasion
By Greene one of Sir Antony Agers men
I pray you sir tell me are not the lands yours
Hath any other interest herein

Arden Mosbie that question well decide anon
Alice make ready my breakfast I must hence      

      Exit Alice

As for the lands Mosbie they are mine
By letters patents from his Majesty
But I must have a mandate for my wife
They say you seek to rob me of her love
Villain what makes thou in her company
Shes no companion for so base a groom

Mosbie Arden I thought not on her I came to thee
But rather than I pocket up this wrong

Franklin What will you do sir

Mosbie Revenge it on the proudest of you both      

      Then Arden draws forth Mosbies sword

Arden So sirrah you may not wear a sword
The statute makes against artificers
I warrant that I do Now use your bodkin
Your Spanish needle and your pressing iron
For this shall go with me and mark my words
You goodman botcher tis to you I speak
The next time that I take thee near my house
Instead of legs Ill make thee crawl on stumps

Mosbie Ah Master Arden you have injured me
I do appeal to God and to the world      

Franklin Why canst thou deny thou wert a botcher once

Mosbie Measure me what I am not what I was

Arden Why what art thou now but a velvet drudge
A cheating steward and baseminded peasant

Mosbie Arden now thou hast belched and vomited
The rancorous venom of thy misswolln heart
Hear me but speak as I intend to live
With God and his elected saints in heaven
I never meant more to solicit her
And that she knows and all the world shall see      
I loved her oncesweet Arden pardon me
I could not choose her beauty fired my heart
But time hath quenched these overraging coals
And Arden though I now frequent thy house
Tis for my sisters sake her waitingmaid
And not for hers Mayest thou enjoy her long
Hellfire and wrathful vengeance light on me
If I dishonour her or injure thee

Arden Mosbie with these thy protestations
The deadly hatred of my hearts appeased      
And thou and Ill be friends if this prove true
As for the base terms I gave thee late
Forget them Mosbie I had cause to speak
When all the knights and gentlemen of Kent
Make common tabletalk of her and thee

Mosbie Who lives that is not touched with slanderous tongues

Franklin Then Mosbie to eschew the speech of men
Upon whose general bruit all honour hangs
Forbear his house

Arden Forbear it nay rather frequent it more      
The world shall see that I distrust her not
To warn him on the sudden from my house
Were to confirm the rumour that is grown

Mosbie By my faith sir you say true
And therefore will I sojourn here a while
Until our enemies have talked their fill
And then I hope theyll cease and at last confess
How causeless they have injured her and me

Arden And I will lie at London all this term
To let them see how light I weigh their words      

Here enters Alice

Alice Husband sit down your breakfast will be cold

Arden Come Master Mosbie will you sit with us

Mosbie I cannot eat but Ill sit for company

Arden Sirrah Michael see our horse be ready

Alice Husband why pause ye why eat you not

Arden I am not well theres something in this broth
That is not wholesome didst thou make it Alice

Alice I did and thats the cause it likes not you

      Then she throws down the broth on the ground

Theres nothing that I do can please your taste
You were best to say I would have poisoned you       
I cannot speak or cast aside my eye
But he imagines I have stepped awry
Heres he that you cast in my teeth so oft
Now will I be convinced or purge myself
I charge thee speak to this mistrustful man
Thou that wouldst see me hang thou Mosbie thou
What favour hast thou had more than a kiss
At coming or departing from the town

Mosbie You wrong yourself and me to cast these doubts
Your loving husband is not jealous      

Arden Why gentle Mistress Alice cannot I be ill
But youll accuse yourself
Franklin thou hast a box of mithridate
Ill take a little to prevent the worst

Franklin Do so and let us presently take horse
My life for yours ye shall do well enough

Alice Give me a spoon Ill eat of it myself
Would it were full of poison to the brim
Then should my cares and troubles have an end
Was ever silly woman so tormented      

Arden Be patient sweet love I mistrust not thee

Alice God will revenge it Arden if thou dost
For never woman loved her husband better
Than I do thee

Arden I know it sweet Alice cease to complain
Lest that in tears I answer thee again

Franklin Come leave this dallying and let us away

Alice Forbear to wound me with that bitter word
Arden shall go to London in my arms

Arden Loth am I to depart yet I must go      

Alice Wilt thou to London then and leave me here
Ah if thou love me gentle Arden stay
Yet if thy business be of great import
Go if thou wilt Ill bear it as I may
But write from London to me every week
Nay every day and stay no longer there
Than thou must needs lest that I die for sorrow

Arden Ill write unto thee every other tide
And so farewell sweet Alice till we meet next

Alice Farewell husband seeing youll have it so      
And Master Franklin seeing you take him hence
In hope youll hasten him home Ill give you this

      And then she kisseth him

Franklin And if he stay the fault shall not be mine
Mosbie farewell and see you keep your oath

Mosbie I hope he is not jealous of me now

Arden No Mosbie no hereafter think of me
As of your dearest friend and so farewell

      Exeunt Arden Franklin and Michael

Alice I am glad he is gone he was about to stay
But did you mark me then how I brake off

Mosbie Ay Alice and it was cunningly performed      
But what a villain is that painter Clarke

Alice Was it not a goodly poison that he gave
Why hes as well now as he was before
It should have been some fine confection
That might have given the broth some dainty taste
This powder was too gross and populous

Mosbie But had he eaten but three spoonfuls more
Then had he died and our love continued

Alice Why so it shall Mosbie albeit he live

Mosbie It is unpossible for I have sworn      
Never hereafter to solicit thee
Or whilst he lives once more importune thee

Alice Thou shalt not need I will importune thee
What shall an oath make thee forsake my love
As if I have not sworn as much myself
And given my hand unto him in the church
Tush Mosbie oaths are words and words is wind
And wind is mutable then I conclude
Tis childishness to stand upon an oath

Mosbie Well proved Mistress Alice yet by your leave      
Ill keep mine unbroken whilst he lives

Alice Ay do and spare not his time is but short
For if thou beest as resolute as I
Well have him murdered as he walks the streets
In London many alehouse ruffians keep
Which as I hear will murder men for gold
They shall be soundly feed to pay him home

Here enters Greene

Mosbie Alice whats he that comes yonder knowest thou him

Alice Mosbie be gone I hope tis one that comes
To put in practice our intended drifts      

      Exit Mosbie

Greene Mistress Arden you are well met
I am sorry that your husband is from home
Whenas my purposed journey was to him
Yet all my labour is not spent in vain
For I suppose that you can full discourse
And flat resolve me of the thing I seek

Alice What is it Master Greene If that I may
Or can with safety I will answer you

Greene I heard your husband hath the grant of late
Confirmed by letters patents from the king      
Of all the lands of the Abbey of Feversham
Generally intitled so that all former grants
Are cut off whereof I myself had one
But now my interest by that is void
This is all Mistress Arden is it true or no

Alice True Master Greene the lands are his in state
And whatsoever leases were before
Are void for term of Master Ardens life
He hath the grant under the Chancery seal

Greene Pardon me Mistress Arden I must speak      
For I am touched Your husband doth me wrong
To wring me from the little land I have
My living is my life and only that
Resteth remainder of my portion
Desire of wealth is endless in his mind
And he is greedygaping still for gain
Nor cares he though young gentlemen do beg
So he may scrape and hoard up in his pouch
But seeing he hath taen my lands Ill value life
As careless as he is careful for to get      
And tell him this from me Ill be revenged
And so as he shall wish the Abbey lands
Had rested still within their former state

Alice Alas poor gentleman I pity you
And woe is me that any man should want
God knows tis not my fault but wonder not
Though he be hard to others when to me
Ah Master Greene God knows how I am used

Greene Why Mistress Arden can the crabbed churl
Use you unkindly respects he not your birth      
Your honourable friends nor what you brought
Why all Kent knows your parentage and what you are

Alice Ah Master Greene be it spoken in secret here
I never live good day with him alone
When hes at home then have I froward looks
Hard words and blows to mend the match withal
And though I might content as good a man
Yet doth he keep in every corner trulls
And when hes weary with his trugs at home
Then rides he straight to London there forsooth      
He revels it among such filthy ones
As counsels him to make away his wife
Thus live I daily in continual fear
In sorrow so despairing of redress
As every day I wish with hearty prayer
That he or I were taken forth the world

Greene Now trust me Mistress Alice it grieveth me
So fair a creature should be so abused
Why who would have thought the civil sir so sullen
He looks so smoothly Now fie upon him churl       
And if he live a day he lives too long
But frolic woman I shall be the man
Shall set you free from all this discontent
And if the churl deny my interest
And will not yield my lease into my hand
Ill pay him home whatever hap to me

Alice But speak you as you think

Greene Ay Gods my witness I mean plain dealing
For I had rather die than lose my land

Alice Then Master Greene be counselld by me      
Indanger not yourself for such a churl
But hire some cutter for to cut him short
And heres ten pound to wager them withal
When he is dead you shall have twenty more
And the lands whereof my husband is possessd
Shall be intitled as they were before

Greene Will you keep promise with me

Alice Or count me false and perjured whilst I live

Greene Then heres my hand Ill have him so dispatched
Ill up to London straight Ill thither post      
And never rest till I have compassed it
Till then farewell

Alice Good fortune follow all your forward thoughts

      Exit Greene

And whosoever doth attempt the deed
A happy hand I wish and so farewell
All this goes well Mosbie I long for thee
To let thee know all that I have contrived

Here enters Mosbie and Clarke

Mosbie How now Alice whats the news

Alice Such as will content thee well sweetheart

Mosbie Well let them pass a while and tell me Alice
How have you dealt and tempered with my sister
What will she have my neighbour Clarke or no

Alice What Master Mosbie let him woo himself
Think you that maids look not for fair words
Go to her Clarke shes all alone within
Michael my man is clean out of her books

Clarke I thank you Mistress Arden I will in
And if fair Susan and I can make a gree
You shall command me to the uttermost
As far as either goods or life may stretch      

      Exit Clarke

Mosbie Now Alice lets hear thy news

Alice They be so good that I must laugh for joy
Before I can begin to tell my tale

Mosbie Lets hear them that I may laugh for company

Alice This morning Master Greene Dick Greene I mean
From whom my husband had the Abbey land
Came hither railing for to know the truth
Whether my husband had the lands by grant
I told him all whereat he stormed amain
And swore he would cry quittance with the churl      
And if he did deny his interest
Stab him whatsoever did befall himself
Whenas I saw his choler thus to rise
I whetted on the gentleman with words
And to conclude Mosbie at last we grew
To composition for my husbands death
I gave him ten pound for to hire knaves
By some device to make away the churl
When he is dead he should have twenty more
And repossess his former lands again      
On this we greed and he is ridden straight
To London for to bring his death about

Mosbie But call you this good news

Alice Ay sweetheart be they not

Mosbie Twere cheerful news to hear the churl were dead
But trust me Alice I take it passing ill
You would be so forgetful of our state
To make recount of it to every groom
What to acquaint each stranger with our drifts
Chiefly in case of murder why tis the way      
To make it open unto Ardens self
And bring thyself and me to ruin both
Forewarned forearmed who threats his enemy
Lends him a sword to guard himself withal

Alice I did it for the best

Mosbie Well seeing tis done cheerly let it pass
You know this Greene is he not religious
A man I guess of great devotion

Alice He is

Mosbie Then sweet Alice let it pass I have a drift      
Will quiet all whatever is amiss

Here enters Clarke and Susan

Alice How now Clarke have you found me false
Did I not plead the matter hard for you

Clarke You did

Mosbie And what wilt be a match

Clarke A match i faith sir ay the day is mine
The painter lays his colours to the life
His pencil draws no shadows in his love
Susan is mine

Alice You make her blush      

Mosbie What sister is it Clarke must be the man

Susan It resteth in your grant some words are past
And haply we be grown unto a match
If you be willing that it shall be so

Mosbie Ah Master Clarke it resteth at my grant
You see my sisters yet at my dispose
But so youll grant me one thing I shall ask
I am content my sister shall be yours

Clarke What is it Master Mosbie

Mosbie I do remember once in secret talk      
You told me how you could compound by art
A crucifix impoisoned
That whoso look upon it should wax blind
And with the scent be stifled that ere long
He should die poisoned that did view it well
I would have you make me such a crucifix
And then Ill grant my sister shall be yours

Clarke Though I am loth because it toucheth life
Yet rather or Ill leave sweet Susans love
Ill do it and with all the haste I may      
But for whom is it

Alice Leave that to us Why Clarke is it possible
That you should paint and draw it out yourself
The colours being baleful and impoisoned
And no ways prejudice yourself withal

Mosbie Well questioned Alice Clarke how answer you that

Clarke Very easily Ill tell you straight
How I do work of these impoisoned drugs
I fasten on my spectacles so close
As nothing can any way offend my sight      
Then as I put a leaf within my nose
So put I rhubarb to avoid the smell
And softly as another work I paint

Mosbie Tis very well but against when shall I have it

Clarke Within this ten days

Mosbie                       Twill serve the turn
Now Alice lets in and see what cheer you keep
I hope now Master Arden is from home
Youll give me leave to play your husbands part

Alice Mosbie you know whos master of my heart
He well may be the master of the house

ACT II


SCENE I

Country between Feversham and London

Enter Greene and Bradshaw

Bradshaw See you them that comes yonder Master Greene

Greene Ay very well do you know them

Here enters Black Will and Shakebag

Bradshaw The one I know not but he seems a knave
Chiefly for bearing the other company
For such a slave so vile a rogue as he
Lives not again upon the earth
Black Will is his name I tell you Master Greene
At Boulogne he and I were fellowsoldiers
Where he played such pranks
As all the camp feared him for his villainy      
I warrant you he bears so bad a mind
That for a crown hell murder any man

Greene The fitter is he for my purpose marry

Will How now fellow Bradshaw Whither away so early

Bradshaw O Will times are changed no fellows now
Though we were once together in the field
Yet thy friend to do thee any good I can

Will Why Bradshaw was not thou and I fellowsoldiers
at Boulogne where I was a corporal and
thou but a base mercenary groom No fellows
now because you are a goldsmith and have a little
plate in your shop You were glad to call me
fellow Will and with a curtsey to the earth One
snatch good corporal when I stole the half ox
from John the victualer and domineerd with it
amongst good fellows in one night

Bradshaw Ay Will those days are past with me      

Will Ay but they be not past with me for I keep that
same honourable mind still Good neighbour Bradshaw
you are too proud to be my fellow but were
it not that I see more company coming down the
hill I would be fellows with you once more and
share crowns with you too But let that pass and
tell me whither you go

Bradshaw To London Will about a piece of service
Wherein haply thou mayest pleasure me

Will What is it

Bradshaw Of late Lord Cheiny lost some plate
Which one did bring and sold it at my shop
Saying he served Sir Antony Cooke      
A search was made the plate was found with me
And I am bound to answer at the size
Now Lord Cheiny solemnly vows if law
Will serve him hell hang me for his plate
Now I am going to London upon hope
To find the fellow Now Will I know
Thou art acquainted with such companions

Will What manner of man was he

Bradshaw A leanfaced writhen knave
Hawknosed and very holloweyed      
With mighty furrows in his stormy brows
Long hair down his shoulders curled
His chin was bare but on his upper lip
A mutchado which he wound about his ear

Will What apparel had he

Bradshaw A watchet satin doublet allto torn
The inner side did bear the greater show
A pair of threadbare velvet hose seam rent
A worsted stocking rent above the shoe
A livery cloak but all the lace was off      
Twas bad but yet it served to hide the plate

Will Sirrah Shakebag canst thou remember since we
trolled the bowl at Sittingburgh where I broke the
tapsters head of the Lion with a cudgelstick

Shakebag Ay very well Will

Will Why it was with the money that the plate was
sold for Sirrah Bradshaw what wilt thou give him
that can tell thee who sold thy plate

Bradshaw Who I pray thee good Will

Will Why twas one Jack Fitten Hes now in Newgate
for stealing a horse and shall be arraigned the next size      

Bradshaw Why then let Lord Cheiny seek Jack Fitten forth
For Ill back and tell him who robbed him of his plate
This cheers my heart Master Greene Ill leave you
For I must to the Isle of Sheppy with speed

Greene Before you go let me intreat you
To carry this letter to Mistress Arden of Feversham
And humbly recommend me to herself

Bradshaw That will I Master Greene and so farewell      
Here Will theres a crown for thy good news

      Exit Bradshaw

Will Farewell Bradshaw Ill drink no water for thy
sake whilst this lastsNow gentleman shall we
have your company to London

Greene Nay stay sirs
A little more I needs must use your help
And in a matter of great consequence
Wherein if youll be secret and profound
Ill give you twenty angels for your pains      

Will How twenty angels give my fellow George
Shakebag and me twenty angels And if thoult
have thy own father slain that thou mayst inherit
his land well kill him      

Shakebag Ay thy mother thy sister thy brother
or all thy kin

Greene Well this it is Arden of Feversham
Hath highly wronged me about the Abbey land
That no revenge but death will serve the turn
Will you two kill him heres the angels down
And I will lay the platform of his death       

Will Plat me no platforms give me the money and
Ill stab him as he stands pissing against a wall but
Ill kill him

Shakebag Where is he

Greene He is now at London in Aldersgate Street

Shakebag Hes dead as if he had been condemned by
an Act of Parliament if once Black Will and I
swear his death

Greene Here is ten pound and when he is dead
Ye shall have twenty more      

Will My fingers itches to be at the peasant Ah that
I might be set a work thus through the year and
that murder would grow to an occupation that a
man might follow without danger of lawzounds I
warrant I should be warden of the company Come
let us be going and well bait at Rochester where
Ill give thee a gallon of sack to handsel the match
withal

SCENE II

London A Street near St Pauls

Enter Michael

Michael I have gotten such a letter as will touch the
painter And thus it is

Here enters Arden and Franklin and hears Michael
read this letter

My duty remembered Mistress Susan hoping in God
you be in good health as I Michael was at the
making hereof This is to certify you that as the
turtle true when she hath lost her mate sitteth
alone so I mourning for your absence do walk
up and down Pauls till one day I fell asleep and
lost my masters pantofles Ah Mistress Susan
abolish that paltry painter cut him off by the
shins with a frowning look of your crabbed countenance
and think upon Michael who drunk with
the dregs of your favour will cleave as fast to your
love as a plaster of pitch to a galled horseback
Thus hoping you will let my passions penetrate or
rather impetrate mercy of your meek hands I end

    Yours Michael or else not Michael

Arden Why you paltry knave
Stand you here loitering knowing my affairs
What haste my business craves to send to Kent      

Franklin Faith friend Michael this is very ill
Knowing your master hath no more but you
And do ye slack his business for your own

Arden Where is the letter sirrah let me see it

      Then he gives him the letter

See Master Franklin heres proper stuff
Susan my maid the painter and my man
A crew of harlots all in love forsooth
Sirrah let me hear no more of this
Nor for thy life once write to her a word

Here enters Greene Will and Shakebag

Wilt thou be married to so base a trull      
Tis Mosbies sister come I once at home
Ill rouse her from remaining in my house
Now Master Franklin let us go walk in Pauls
Come but a turn or two and then away

      Exeunt

Greene The first is Arden and thats his man
The other is Franklin Ardens dearest friend

Will Zounds Ill kill them all three

Greene Nay sirs touch not his man in any case
But stand close and take you fittest standing
And at his coming forth speed him      
To the Nags Head there is this cowards haunt
But now Ill leave you till the deed be done

      Exit Greene

Shakebag If he be not paid his own neer trust Shakebag

Will Sirrah Shakebag at his coming forth Ill run him
through and then to the Blackfriars and there
take water and away

Shakebag Why thats the best but see thou miss him not

Will How can I miss him when I think on the forty
angels I must have more

Here enters Prentice

Prentice Tis very late I were best shut up my stall
for here will be old filching when the press comes
forth of Pauls      

      Then lets he down his window and it breaks Black Wills head

Will Zounds draw Shakebag I am almost killed

Prentice Well tame you I warrant

Will Zounds I am tame enough already

Here enters Arden Franklin and Michael

Arden What troublesome fray or mutiny is this

Franklin Tis nothing but some brabling paltry fray
Devised to pick mens pockets in the throng

Arden Ist nothing else come Franklin lets away

      Exeunt

Will What mends shall I have for my broken head      

Prentice Marry this mends that if you get you not
away all the sooner you shall be well beaten and
sent to the Counter      Exit Prentice

Will Well Ill be gone but look to your signs for Ill
pull them down all Shakebag my broken head
grieves me not so much as by this means Arden
hath escaped

Here enters Greene

I had a glimpse of him and his companion

Greene Why sirs Ardens as well as I I met him and
Franklin going merrily to the ordinary What dare
you not do it      

Will Yes sir we dare do it but were my consent to
give again we would not do it under ten pound
more I value every drop of my blood at a French
crown I have had ten pound to steal a dog and we
have no more here to kill a man but that a bargain
is a bargain and so forth you should do it yourself

Greene I pray thee how came thy head broke

Will Why thou seest it is broke dost thou not      

Shakebag Standing against a stall watching Ardens
coming a boy let down his shopwindow and broke
his head whereupon arose a brawl and in the
tumult Arden escaped us and passed by unthought
on But forbearance is no acquittance another
time well do it I warrant thee

Greene I pray thee Will make clean thy bloody brow
And let us bethink us on some other place
Where Arden may be met with handsomely
Remember how devoutly thou hast sworn
To kill the villain think upon thine oath      

Will Tush I have broken five hundred oaths
But wouldst thou charm me to effect this deed
Tell me of gold my resolutions fee
Say thou seest Mosbie kneeling at my knees
Offering me service for my high attempt
And sweet Alice Arden with a lap of crowns
Comes with a lowly curtsey to the earth
Saying Take this but for thy quarterage
Such yearly tribute will I answer thee
Why this would steel softmettled cowardice      
With which Black Will was never tainted yet
I tell thee Greene the forlorn traveller
Whose lips are glued with summers parching heat
Neer longed so much to see a running brook
As I to finish Ardens tragedy
Seest thou this gore that cleaveth to my face
From hence neer will I wash this bloody stain
Till Ardens heart be panting in my hand

Greene Why thats well said but what saith Shakebag

Shakebag I cannot paint my valour out with words      
But give me place and opportunity
Such mercy as the starven lioness
When she is dry sucked of her eager young
Shows to the prey that next encounters her
On Arden so much pity would I take

Greene So should it fare with men of firm resolve
And now sirs seeing that this accident
Of meeting him in Pauls hath no success
Let us bethink us of some other place
Whose earth may swallow up this Ardens blood

Here enters Michael

See yonder comes his man and wot you what      
The foolish knaves in love with Mosbies sister
And for her sake whose love he cannot get
Unless Mosbie solicit his suit
The villain hath sworn the slaughter of his master
Well question him for he may stead us much
How now Michael whither are you going

Michael My master hath new supped
And I am going to prepare his chamber

Greene Where supped Master Arden      

Michael At the Nags Head at the eighteen pence
ordinary How now Master Shakebag what
Black Will Gods dear lady how chance your
face is so bloody

Will Go to sirrah there is a chance in it this sauciness
in you will make you be knocked

Michael Nay an you be offended Ill be gone

Greene Stay Michael you may not escape us so
Michael I know you love your master well

Michael Why so I do but wherefore urge you that

Greene Because I think you love your mistress better

Michael So think not I but say i faith what if I should

Shakebag Come to the purpose Michael we hear      
You have a pretty love in Feversham

Michael Why have I two or three whats that to thee

Will You deal too mildly with the peasant Thus it is
Tis known to us that you love Mosbies sister
We know besides that you have taen your oath
To further Mosbie to your mistress bed
And kill your master for his sisters sake
Now sir a poorer coward than yourself      
Was never fostered in the coast of Kent
How comes it then that such a knave as you
Dare swear a matter of such consequence

Greene Ah Will

Will Tush give me leave theres no more but this
Sith thou hast sworn we dare discover all
And hadst thou or shouldst thou utter it
We have devised a complat under hand
Whatever shall betide to any of us
To send thee roundly to the devil of hell      
And therefore thus I am the very man
Marked in my birthhour by the destinies
To give an end to Ardens life on earth
Thou but a member but to whet the knife
Whose edge must search the closet of his breast
Thy office is but to appoint the place
And train thy master to his tragedy
Mine to perform it when occasion serves
Then be not nice but here devise with us
How and what way we may conclude his death      

Shakebag So shalt thou purchase Mosbie for thy friend
And by his friendship gain his sisters love

Greene So shall thy mistress be thy favourer
And thou disburdened of the oath thou made

Michael Well gentlemen I cannot but confess
Sith you have urged me so apparently
That I have vowed my master Ardens death
And he whose kindly love and liberal hand
Doth challenge nought but good deserts of me
I will deliver over to your hands       
This night come to his house at Aldersgate
The doors Ill leave unlockd against you come
No sooner shall ye enter through the latch
Over the threshold to the inner court
But on your left hand shall you see the stairs
That leads directly to my masters chamber
There take him and dispose him as ye please
Now it were good we parted company
What I have promised I will perform

Will Should you deceive us twould go wrong with you      

Michael I will accomplish all I have revealed

Will Come lets go drink choler makes me as dry as a dog      

      Exeunt Will Greene and Shakebag
      Manet Michael

Michael Thus feeds the lamb securely on the down
Whilst through the thicket of an arbour brake
The hungerbitten wolf oerpries his haunt
And takes advantage for to eat him up
Ah harmless Arden how hast thou misdone
That thus thy gentle life is levelled at
The many good turns that thou hast done to me      
Now must I quittance with betraying thee
I that should take the weapon in my hand
And buckler thee from illintending foes
Do lead thee with a wicked fraudful smile
As unsuspected to the slaughterhouse
So have I sworn to Mosbie and my mistress
So have I promised to the slaughtermen
And should I not deal currently with them
Their lawless rage would take revenge on me
Tush I will spurn at mercy for this once      
Let pity lodge where feeble women lie
I am resolved and Arden needs must die

      Exit Michael

ACT III


SCENE I

A Room in Franklins House at Aldersgate

Enter Arden and Franklin

Arden No Franklin no if fear or stormy threats
If love of me or care of womanhood
If fear of God or common speech of men
Who mangle credit with their wounding words
And couch dishonour as dishonour buds
Might join repentance in her wanton thoughts
No question then but she would turn the leaf
And sorrow for her dissolution
But she is rooted in her wickedness
Perverse and stubborn not to be reclaimed      
Good counsel is to her as rain to weeds
And reprehension makes her vice to grow
As Hydras head that plenished by decay
Her faults methink are painted in my face
For every searching eye to overread
And Mosbies name a scandal unto mine
Is deeply trenchd in my blushing brow
Ah Franklin Franklin when I think on this
My hearts grief rends my other powers
Worse than the conflict at the hour of death      

Franklin Gentle Arden leave this sad lament
She will amend and so your griefs will cease
Or else shell die and so your sorrows end
If neither of these two do haply fall
Yet let your comfort be that others bear
Your woes twice doubled all with patience

Arden My house is irksome there I cannot rest

Franklin Then stay with me in London go not home

Arden Then that base Mosbie doth usurp my room
And makes his triumph of my being thence      
At home or not at home whereer I be
Here here it lies ah Franklin here it lies
That will not out till wretched Arden dies

Here enters Michael

Franklin Forget your griefs a while here comes your man

Arden What aclock ist sirrah

Michael Almost ten

Arden See see how runs away the weary time
Come Master Franklin shall we go to bed

      Exeunt Arden and Michael
      Manet Franklin

Franklin I pray you go before Ill follow you
Ah what a hell is fretful jealousy      
What pitymoving words what deepfetched sighs
What grievous groans and overlading woes
Accompanies this gentle gentleman
Now will he shake his careoppressd head
Then fix his sad eyes on the sullen earth
Ashamed to gaze upon the open world
Now will he cast his eyes up towards the heavens
Looking that ways for redress of wrong
Sometimes he seeketh to beguile his grief
And tells a story with his careful tongue      
Then comes his wifes dishonour in his thoughts
And in the middle cutteth off his tale
Pouring fresh sorrow on his weary limbs
So woebegone so inly charged with woe
Was never any lived and bare it so

Here enters Michael

Michael My master would desire you come to bed

Franklin Is he himself already in his bed

      Exit Franklin Manet Michael

Michael He is and fain would have the light away
Conflicting thoughts encampd in my breast
Awake me with the echo of their strokes      
And I a judge to censure either side
Can give to neither wishd victory
My masters kindness pleads to me for life
With just demand and I must grant it him
My mistress she hath forced me with an oath
For Susans sake the which I may not break
For that is nearer than a masters love
That grimfaced fellow pitiless Black Will
And Shakebag stern in bloody stratagem
Two rougher ruffians never lived in Kent      
Have sworn my death if I infringe my vow
A dreadful thing to be considered of
Methinks I see them with their bolstered hair
Staring and grinning in thy gentle face
And in their ruthless hands their daggers drawn
Insulting oer thee with a peck of oaths
Whilst thou submissive pleading for relief
Art mangled by their ireful instruments
Methinks I hear them ask where Michael is
And pitiless Black Will cries Stab the slave      
The peasant will detect the tragedy
The wrinkles in his foul deaththreatning face
Gapes open wide like graves to swallow men
My death to him is but a merriment
And he will murder me to make him sport
He comes he comes ah Master Franklin help
Call on the neighbours or we are but dead

Here enters Franklin and Arden

Franklin What dismal outcry calls me from my rest

Arden What hath occasioned such a fearful cry
Speak Michael hath any injured thee      

Michael Nothing sir but as I fell asleep
Upon the threshold leaning to the stairs
I had a fearful dream that troubled me
And in my slumber thought I was beset
With murderer thieves that came to rifle me
My trembling joints witness my inward fear
I crave your pardons for disturbing you

Arden So great a cry for nothing I neer heard
What are the doors fast locked and all things safe

Michael I cannot tell I think I locked the doors      

Arden I like not this but Ill go see myself
Neer trust me but the doors were all unlocked
This negligence not half contenteth me
Get you to bed and if you love my favour
Let me have no more such pranks as these
Come Master Franklin let us go to bed

Franklin Ay by my faith the air is very cold
Michael farewell I pray thee dream no more

      Exeunt

SCENE II

Outside Franklins house

Here enters Will Greene and Shakebag

Shakebag Black night hath hid the pleasures of the day
And sheeting darkness overhangs the earth
And with the black fold of her cloudy robe
Obscures us from the eyesight of the world
In which sweet silence such as we triumph
The lazy minutes linger on their time
As loth to give due audit to the hour
Till in the watch our purpose be complete
And Arden sent to everlasting night
Greene get you gone and linger here about      
And at some hour hence come to us again
Where we will give you instance of his death

Greene Speed to my wish whose will so eer says no
And so Ill leave you for an hour or two

      Exit Greene

Will I tell thee Shakebag would this thing were done
I am so heavy that I can scarce go
This drowsiness in me bodes little good

Shakebag How now Will become a precisian
Nay then lets go sleep when bugs and fears
Shall kill our courages with their fancys work      

Will Why Shakebag thou mistakes me much
And wrongs me too in telling me of fear
Weret not a serious thing we go about
It should be slipt till I had fought with thee
To let thee know I am no coward I
I tell thee Shakebag thou abusest me

Shakebag Why thy speech bewrayed an inly kind of fear
And savoured of a weak relenting spirit
Go forward now in that we have begun
And afterwards attempt me when thou darest      

Will And if I do not heaven cut me off
But let that pass and show me to this house
Where thou shalt see Ill do as much as Shakebag

Shakebag This is the door but soft methinks tis shut
The villain Michael hath deceived us

Will Soft let me see Shakebag tis shut indeed
Knock with thy sword perhaps the slave will hear

Shakebag It will not be the whitelivered peasant
Is gone to bed and laughs us both to scorn

Will And he shall buy his merriment as dear      
As ever coistril bought so little sport
Neer let this sword assist me when I need
But rust and canker after I have sworn
If I the next time that I meet the hind
Lop not away his leg his arm or both

Shakebag And let me never draw a sword again
Nor prosper in the twilight cockshut light
When I would fleece the wealthy passenger
But lie and languish in a loathsome den
Hated and spit at by the goersby      
And in that death may die unpitied
If I the next time that I meet the slave
Cut not the nose from off the cowards face
And trample on it for this villainy

Will Come lets go seek out Greene I know hell swear

Shakebag He were a villain an he would not swear
Twould make a peasant swear among his boys
That neer durst say before but yea and no
To be thus flouted of a coistril

Will Shakebag lets seek out Greene and in the morning      
At the alehouse butting Ardens house
Watch the outcoming of that prickeared cur
And then let me alone to handle him      Exeunt

SCENE III

Room in Franklins house as before

Here enters Arden Franklin and Michael

Arden Sirrah get you back to Billingsgate
And learn what time the tide will serve our turn
Come to us in Pauls First go make the bed
And afterwards go hearken for the flood

      Exit Michael

Come Master Franklin you shall go with me
This night I dreamt that being in a park
A toil was pitched to overthrow the deer
And I upon a little rising hill
Stood whistly watching for the herds approach
Even there methoughts a gentle slumber took me      
And summoned all my parts to sweet repose
But in the pleasure of this golden rest
An illthewed foster had removed the toil
And rounded me with that beguiling home
Which late methought was pitched to cast the deer
With that he blew an evilsounding horn
And at the noise another herdman came
With falchion drawn and bent it at my breast
Crying aloud Thou art the game we seek
With this I woke and trembled every joint      
Like one obscured in a little bush
That sees a lion foraging about
And when the dreadful forestking is gone
He pries about with timorous suspect
Throughout the thorny casements of the brake
And will not think his person dangerless
But quakes and shivers though the cause be gone
So trust me Franklin when I did awake
I stood in doubt whether I waked or no
Such great impression took this fond surprise      
God grant this vision bedeem me any good

Franklin This fantasy doth rise from Michaels fear
Who being awaked with the noise he made
His troubled senses yet could take no rest
And this I warrant you procured your dream

Arden It may be so God frame it to the best
But oftentimes my dreams presage too true

Franklin To such as note their nightly fantasies
Some one in twenty may incur belief
But use it not tis but a mockery      

Arden Come Master Franklin well now walk in Pauls
And dine together at the ordinary
And by my mans direction draw to the quay
And with the tide go down to Feversham
Say Master Franklin shall it not be so

Franklin At your good pleasure sir Ill bear you company Exeunt

III iii  rounded me  brought me round

thoughts which should indeed have died

SCENE IV

Aldersgate

Here enters Michael at one door

Here enters Greene Will and Shakebag at
another door

Will Draw Shakebag for heres that villain Michael

Greene First Will lets hear what he can say

Will Speak milksop slave and never after speak

Michael For Gods sake sirs let me excuse myself
For here I swear by heaven and earth and all
I did perform the utmost of my task
And left the doors unbolted and unlocked
But see the chance Franklin and my master
Were very late conferring in the porch
And Franklin left his napkin where he sat      
With certain gold knit in it as he said
Being in bed he did bethink himself
And coming down he found the doors unshut
He locked the gates and brought away the keys
For which offence my master rated me
But now I am going to see what flood it is
For with the tide my master will away
Where you may front him well on Rainham Down
A place wellfitting such a stratagem

Will Your excuse hath somewhat mollified my choler
Why now Greene tis better now nor eer it was      

Greene But Michael is this true

Michael As true as I report it to be true

Shakebag Then Michael this shall be your penance
To feast us all at the Salutation
Where we will plat our purpose thoroughly

Greene And Michael you shall bear no news of this tide
Because they two may be in Rainham Down
Before your master

Michael Why Ill agree to anything youll have me
So you will except of my company      Exeunt

III iv  The country near Rainham seems in the sixteenth
century to have been so open as to have entitled it to the appellation
of a DownDonne The spot had a bad reputation

Fair

SCENE V

Ardens House at Feversham

Here enters Mosbie

Mosbie Disturbd thoughts drives me from company
And dries my marrow with their watchfulness
Continual trouble of my moody brain
Feebles my body by excess of drink
And nips me as the bitter northeast wind
Doth check the tender blossoms in the spring
Well fares the man howeer his cates do taste
That tables not with foul suspicion
And he but pines amongst his delicates
Whose troubled mind is stuffed with discontent      
My golden time was when I had no gold
Though then I wanted yet I slept secure
My daily toil begat me nights repose
My nights repose made daylight fresh to me
But since I climbed the topbough of the tree
And sought to build my nest among the clouds
Each gentle stirry gale doth shake my bed
And makes me dread my downfall to the earth
But whither doth contemplation carry me
The way I seek to find where pleasure dwells      
Is hedged behind me that I cannot back
But needs must on although to dangers gate
Then Arden perish thou by that decree
For Greene doth ear the land and weed thee up
To make my harvest nothing but pure corn
And for his pains Ill hive him up a while
And after smother him to have his wax
Such bees as Greene must never live to sting
Then is there Michael and the painter too
Chief actors to Ardens overthrow      
Who when they shall see me sit in Ardens seat
They will insult upon me for my meed
Or fright me by detecting of his end
Ill none of that for I can cast a bone
To make these curs pluck out each others throat
And then am I sole ruler of mine own
Yet Mistress Arden lives but shes myself
And holy Church rites makes us two but one
But what for that I may not trust you Alice
You have supplanted Arden for my sake      
And will extirpen me to plant another
Tis fearful sleeping in a serpents bed
And I will cleanly rid my hands of her

Here enters Alice

But here she comes and I must flatter her
How now Alice what sad and passionate
Make me partaker of thy pensiveness
Fire divided burns with lesser force

Alice But I will dam that fire in my breast
Till by the force thereof my part consume
Ah Mosbie      

Mosbie Such deep pathaires like to a cannons burst
Discharged against a ruinated wall
Breaks my relenting heart in thousand pieces
Ungentle Alice thy sorrow is my sore
Thou knowst it well and tis thy policy
To forge distressful looks to wound a breast
Where lies a heart that dies when thou art sad
It is not love that loves to anger love

Alice It is not love that loves to murder love

Mosbie How mean you that      

Alice Thou knowest how dearly Arden loved me

Mosbie And then

Alice And thenconceal the rest for tis too bad
Lest that my words be carried with the wind
And published in the world to both our shames
I pray thee Mosbie let our springtime wither
Our harvest else will yield but loathsome weeds
Forget I pray thee what hath passed betwixt us
For how I blush and tremble at the thoughts

Mosbie What are you changed      

Alice Ay to my former happy life again
From title of an odious strumpets name
To honest Ardens wife not Ardens honest wife
Ha Mosbie tis thou has rifled me of that
And made me slanderous to all my kin
Even in my forehead is thy name ingraven
A mean artificer that lowborn name
I was bewitched woe worth the hapless hour
And all the causes that enchanted me

Mosbie Nay if you ban let me breathe curses forth      
And if you stand so nicely at your fame
Let me repent the credit I have lost
I have neglected matters of import
That would have stated me above thy state
Forslowed advantages and spurned at time
Ay Fortunes right hand Mosbie hath forsook
To take a wanton giglot by the left
I left the marriage of an honest maid
Whose dowry would have weighed down all thy wealth
Whose beauty and demeanour far exceeded thee      
This certain good I lost for changing bad
And wrapt my credit in thy company
I was bewitchedthat is no theme of thine
And thou unhallowed has enchanted me
But I will break thy spells and exorcisms
And put another sight upon these eyes
That showed my heart a raven for a dove
Thou art not fair I viewed thee not till now
Thou art not kind till now I knew thee not
And now the rain hath beaten off thy gilt      
Thy worthless copper shows thee counterfeit
It grieves me not to see how foul thou art
But mads me that ever I thought thee fair
Go get thee gone a copesmate for thy hinds
I am too good to be thy favourite

Alice Ay now I see and too soon find it true
Which often hath been told me by my friends
That Mosbie loves me not but for my wealth
Which too incredulous I neer believed
Nay hear me speak Mosbie a word or two      
Ill bite my tongue if it speak bitterly
Look on me Mosbie or Ill kill myself
Nothing shall hide me from thy stormy look
If thou cry war there is no peace for me
I will do penance for offending thee
And burn this prayerbook where I here use
The holy word that had converted me
See Mosbie I will tear away the leaves
And all the leaves and in this golden cover
Shall thy sweet phrases and thy letters dwell      
And thereon will I chiefly meditate
And hold no other sect but such devotion
Wilt thou not look is all thy love oerwhelmed
Wilt thou not hear what malice stops thine ears
Why speaks thou not what silence ties thy tongue
Thou hast been sighted as the eagle is
And heard as quickly as the fearful hare
And spoke as smoothly as an orator
When I have bid thee hear or see or speak
And art thou sensible in none of these      
Weigh all thy good turns with this little fault
And I deserve not Mosbies muddy looks
A fence of trouble is not thickened still
Be clear again Ill neer more trouble thee

Mosbie O no I am a base artificer
My wings are feathered for a lowly flight
Mosbie fie no not for a thousand pound
Make love to you why tis unpardonable
We beggars must not breathe where gentles are

Alice Sweet Mosbie is as gentle as a king      
And I too blind to judge him otherwise
Flowers do sometimes spring in fallow lands
Weeds in gardens roses grow on thorns
So whatsoeer my Mosbies father was
Himself is valued gentle by his worth

Mosbie Ah how you women can insinuate
And clear a trespass with your sweetset tongue
I will forget this quarrel gentle Alice
Provided Ill be tempted so no more

Here enters Bradshaw

Alice Then with thy lips seal up this newmade match

Mosbie Soft Alice here comes somebody      

Alice How now Bradshaw whats the news with you

Bradshaw I have little news but heres a letter
That Master Greene importuned me to give you

Alice Go in Bradshaw call for a cup of beer
Tis almost suppertime thou shalt stay with us

      Exit Bradshaw

Then she reads the letter

We have missed of our purpose at London but shall
perform it by the way We thank our neighbour
BradshawYours Richard Greene
How likes my love the tenor of this letter      

Mosbie Well were his date completed and expired

Alice Ah would it were Then comes my happy hour
Till then my bliss is mixed with bitter gall
Come let us in to shun suspicion

Mosbie Ay to the gates of death to follow thee      Exeunt

SCENE VI

Country near Rochester

Here enters Greene Will and Shakebag

Shakebag Come Will see thy tools be in a readiness
Is not thy powder dank or will thy flint strike fire

Will Then ask me if my nose be on my face
Or whether my tongue be frozen in my mouth
Zounds heres a coil
You were best swear me on the interrogatories
How many pistols I have took in hand
Or whether I love the smell of gunpowder
Or dare abide the noise the dag will make
Or will not wink at flashing of the fire      
I pray thee Shakebag let this answer thee
That I have took more purses in this down
Than eer thou handledst pistols in thy life

Shakebag Ay haply thou has picked more in a throng
But should I brag what booties I have took
I think the overplus thats more than thine
Would mount to a greater sum of money
Then either thou or all thy kin are worth
Zounds I hate them as I hate a toad
That carry a muscado in their tongue      
And scarce a hurting weapon in their hand

Will O Greene intolerable
It is not for mine honour to bear this
Why Shakebag I did serve the king at Boulogne
And thou canst brag of nothing that thou hast done

Shakebag Why so can Jack of Feversham
That sounded for a fillip on the nose
When he that gave it him holloed in his ear
And he supposed a cannonbullet hit him

Then they fight

Greene I pray you sirs list to sops talk      
Whilst two stout dogs were striving for a bone
There comes a cur and stole it from them both
So while you stand striving on these terms of manhood
Arden escapes us and deceives us all

Shakebag Why he begun

Will                   And thou shalt find Ill end
I do but slip it until better time
But if I do forget

      Then he kneels down and holds up
      his hands to heaven

Greene Well take your fittest standings and once more
Lime well your twigs to catch this wary bird
Ill leave you and at your dags discharge      
Make towards like the longing waterdog
That coucheth till the fowlingpiece be off
Then seizeth on the prey with eager mood
Ah might I see him stretching forth his limbs
As I have seen them beat their wings ere now

Shakebag Why that thou shalt see if he come this way

Greene Yes that he doth Shakebag I warrant thee
But brawl not when I am gone in any case
But sirs be sure to speed him when he comes
And in that hope Ill leave you for an hour      

      Exit Greene

Here enters Arden Franklin and Michael

Michael Twere best that I went back to Rochester
The horse halts downright it were not good
He travelled in such pain to Feversham
Removing of a shoe may haply help it

Arden Well get you back to Rochester but sirrah see
Ye oertake us ere we come to Rainham Down
For t will be very late ere we get home

Michael Ay God he knows and so doth Will and Shakebag
That thou shalt never go further than that down
And therefore have I pricked the horse on purpose
Because I would not view the massacre      

      Exit Michael

Arden Come Master Franklin onwards with your tale

Franklin I do assure you sir you task me much
A heavy blood is gathered at my heart
And on the sudden is my wind so short
As hindereth the passage of my speech
So fierce a qualm yet neer assailed me

Arden Come Master Franklin let us go on softly
The annoyance of the dust or else some meat
You ate at dinner cannot brook with you      
I have been often so and soon amended

Franklin Do you remember where my tale did leave

Arden Ay where the gentleman did check his wife

Franklin She being reprehended for the fact
Witness produced that took her with the deed
Her glove brought in which there she left behind
And many other assured arguments
Her husband asked her whether it were not so

Arden Her answer then I wonder how she looked
Having forsworn it with such vehement oaths      
And at the instant so approved upon her

Franklin First did she cast her eyes down to the earth
Watching the drops that fell amain from thence
Then softly draws she forth her handkercher
And modestly she wipes her tearstained face
Them hemmed she out to clear her voice should seem
And with a majesty addressed herself
To encounter all their accusations
Pardon me Master Arden I can no more
This fighting at my heart makes short my wind    

Arden Come we are almost now at Rainham Down
Your pretty tale beguiles the weary way
I would you were in state to tell it out

Shakebag Stand close Will I hear them coming

Here enters Lord Cheiny with his men

Will Stand to it Shakebag and be resolute

L Cheiny Is it so near night as it seems
Or will this blackfaced evening have a shower
What Master Arden you are well met
I have longed this fortnights day to speak with you
You are a stranger man in the Isle of Sheppy      

Arden Your honours always bound to do you service

L Cheiny Come you from London and neer a man with you

Arden My mans coming after but heres
My honest friend that came along with me

L Cheiny My Lord Protectors man I take you to be

Franklin Ay my good lord and highly bound to you

L Cheiny You and your friend come home and sup with me

Arden I beseech your honour pardon me
I have made a promise to a gentleman
My honest friend to meet him at my house      
The occasion is great or else would I wait on you

L Cheiny Will you come tomorrow and dine with me
And bring your honest friend along with you
I have divers matters to talk with you about

Arden Tomorrow well wait upon your honour

L Cheiny One of you stay my horse at the top of the hill
What Black Will for whose purse wait you
Thou wilt be hanged in Kent when all is done

Will Not hanged God save your honour
I am your bedesman bound to pray for you      

L Cheiny I think thou neer saidst prayer in all thy life
One of you give him a crown
And sirrah leave this kind of life
If thou beest tainted for a pennymatter
And come in question surely thou wilt truss
Come Master Arden let us be going
Your way and mine lies four miles together

      Exeunt Manet Black Will and Shakebag

Will The devil break all your necks at four miles end
Zounds I could kill myself for very anger
His lordship chops me in      
Even when my dag was levelled at his heart
I would his crown were molten down his throat

Shakebag Arden thou hast wondrous holy luck
Did ever man escape as thou hast done
Well Ill discharge my pistol at the sky
For by this bullet Arden might not die

Here enters Greene

Greene What is he down is he dispatched

Shakebag Ay in health towards Feversham to shame us all

Greene The devil he is why sirs how escaped he

Shakebag When we were ready to shoot      
Comes my Lord Cheiny to prevent his death

Greene The Lord of Heaven hath preserved him

Will Preserved a fig The Lord Cheiny hath preserved him
And bids him to a feast to his house at Shorlow
But by the way once more Ill meet with him
And if all the Cheinies in the world say no
Ill have a bullet in his breast tomorrow
Therefore come Greene and let us to Feversham

Greene Ay and excuse ourselves to Mistress Arden
O how shell chafe when she hears of this        

Shakebag Why Ill warrant you shell think we dare
not do it

Will Why then let us go and tell her all the matter
And plat the news to cut him off tomorrow

      Exeunt

III vi  Shorlow should be Shurland in Sheppey




ACT IV


SCENE I

Ardens House at Feversham

Here enters Arden and his wife Franklin and Michael

Arden See how the hours the gardant of heavens gate
Have by their toil removed the darksome clouds
That Sol may well discern the trampled path
Wherein he wont to guide his golden car
The season fits come Franklin lets away

Alice I thought you did pretend some special hunt
That made you thus cut short the time of rest

Arden It was no chase that made me rise so early
But as I told thee yesternight to go
To the Isle of Sheppy there to dine with my Lord Cheiny      
For so his honour late commanded me

Alice Ay such kind husbands seldom want excuses
Home is a wild cat to a wandering wit
The time hath beenwould God it were not past
That honours title nor a lords command
Could once have drawn you from these arms of mine
But my deserts or your desires decay
Or both yet if true love may seem desert
I merit still to have thy company

Franklin Why I pray you sir let her go along with us      
I am sure his honour will welcome her
And us the more for bringing her along

Arden Content sirrah saddle your mistress nag

Alice No begged favour merits little thanks
If I should go our house would run away
Or else be stolen therefore Ill stay behind

Arden Nay see how mistaking you are I pray thee go

Alice No no not now

Arden Then let me leave thee satisfied in this
That time nor place nor persons alter me      
But that I hold thee dearer than my life

Alice That will be seen by your quick return

Arden And that shall be ere night and if I live
Farewell sweet Alice we mind to sup with thee

      Exit Alice

Franklin Come Michael are our horses ready

Michael Ay your horse are ready but I am not ready
for I have lost my purse with six and thirty
shillings in it with taking up of my masters nag

Franklin Why I pray you let us go before
Whilst he stays behind to seek his purse      

Arden Go to sirrah see you follow us to the Isle of Sheppy
To my Lord Cheinys where we mean to dine

      Exeunt Arden and Franklin Manet Michael

Michael So fair weather after you for before you lies
Black Will and Shakebag in the broom close too
close for you theyll be your ferrymen to long
home

Here enters the Painter

But who is this the painter my corrival that
would needs win Mistress Susan

Clarke How now Michael how doth my mistress and all at home

Michael Who Susan Mosbie she is your mistress too      

Clarke Ay how doth she and all the rest

Michael Alls well but Susan she is sick

Clarke Sick Of what disease

Michael Of a great fever

Clarke A fear of what

Michael A great fever

Clarke A fever God forbid

Michael Yes faith and of a lordaine too as big as yourself

Clarke O Michael the spleen prickles you Go to
you carry an eye over Mistress Susan      

Michael I faith to keep her from the painter

Clarke Why more from a painter than from a serving
creature like yourself

Michael Because you painters make but a painting
table of a pretty wench and spoil her beauty with
blotting

Clarke What mean you by that

Michael Why that you painters paint lambs in the lining
of wenches petticoats and we servingmen put
horns to them to make them become sheep        

Clarke Such another word will cost you a cuff or a
knock

Michael What with a dagger made of a pencil Faith
tis too weak and therefore thou too weak to win
Susan

Clarke Would Susans love lay upon this stroke


      Then he breaks Michaels head

Here enters Mosbie Greene and Alice

Alice Ill lay my life this is for Susans love
Stayed you behind your master to this end
Have you no other time to brable in
But now when serious matters are in hand
Say Clarke hast thou done the thing thou promised        

Clarke Ay here it is the very touch is death

Alice Then this I hope if all the rest do fail
Will catch Master Arden
And make him wise in death that lived a fool
Why should he thrust his sickle in our corn
Or what hath he to do with thee my love
Or govern me that am to rule myself
Forsooth for credit sake I must leave thee
Nay he must leave to live that we may love
May live may love for what is life but love        
And love shall last as long as life remains
And life shall end before my love depart

Mosbie Why what is love without true constancy
Like to a pillar built of many stones
Yet neither with good mortar well compact
Nor with cement to fasten it in the joints
But that it shakes with every blast of wind
And being touched straight falls unto the earth
And buries all his haughty pride in dust
No let our love be rocks of adamant        
Which time nor place nor tempest can asunder

Greene Mosbie leave protestations now
And let us bethink us what we have to do
Black Will and Shakebag I have placed i the broom
Close watching Ardens coming lets to them
And see what they have done      Exeunt

SCENE II

The Kentish Coast opposite the Isle of Sheppy

Here enters Arden and Franklin

Arden Oh ferryman where art thou

Here enters the Ferryman

Ferryman Here here go before to the boat and I will
follow you

Arden We have great haste I pray thee come away

Ferryman Fie what a mist is here

Arden This mist my friend is mystical
Like to a good companions smoky brain
That was half drowned with new ale overnight

Ferryman Twere pity but his skull were opened to
make more chimney room        

Franklin Friend whats thy opinion of this mist

Ferryman I think tis like to a curst wife in a little
house that never leaves her husband till she have
driven him out at doors with a wet pair of eyes
then looks he as if his house were afire or some of
his friends dead

Arden Speaks thou this of thine own experience

Ferryman Perhaps ay perhaps no For my wife is
as other women are that is to say governed by the
moon        

Franklin By the moon how I pray thee

Ferryman Nay thereby lies a bargain and you shall
not have it fresh and fasting

Arden Yes I pray thee good ferryman

Ferryman Then for this once let it be midsummer
moon but yet my wife has another moon

Franklin Another moon

Ferryman Ay and it hath influences and eclipses

Arden Why then by this reckoning you sometimes
play the man in the moon        

Ferryman Ay but you had not best to meddle with
that moon lest I scratch you by the face with my
bramblebush

Arden I am almost stifled with this fog come lets
away

Franklin And sirrah as we go let us have some more
of your bold yeomanry

Ferryman Nay by my troth sir but flat knavery

      Exeunt

SCENE III

Another place on the coast

Here enters Will at one door and Shakebag at another

Shakebag Oh Will where art thou

Will Here Shakebag almost in hells mouth where I
cannot see my way for smoke

Shakebag I pray thee speak still that we may meet by
the sound for I shall fall into some ditch or other
unless my feet see better than my eyes

Will Didst thou ever see better weather to run away
with another mans wife or play with a wench at
potfinger      

Shakebag No this were a fine world for chandlers if
this weather would last for then a man should
never dine nor sup without candlelight But
sirrah Will what horses are those that passed

Will Why didst thou hear any

Shakebag Ay that I did

Will My life for thine twas Arden and his companion
and then all our labours lost

Shakebag Nay say not so for if it be they they may
haply lose their way as we have done and then we
may chance meet with them      

Will Come let us go on like a couple of blind pilgrims

      Then Shakebag falls into a ditch

Shakebag Help Will help I am almost drowned

Here enters the Ferryman

Ferryman Whos that that calls for help

Will Twas none here twas thou thyself

Ferryman I came to help him that called for help
Why how now who is this thats in the ditch
You are well enough served to go without a guide
such weather as this

Will Sirrah what companies hath passed your ferry
this morning        

Ferryman None but a couple of gentlemen that went
to dine at my Lord Cheinys

Will Shakebag did not I tell thee as much

Ferryman Why sir will you have any letters carried
to them

Will No sir get you gone

Ferryman Did you ever see such a mist as this

Will No nor such a fool as will rather be hought than
get his way

Ferryman Why sir this is no HoughMonday you
are deceivedWhats his name I pray you sir        

Shakebag His name is Black Will

Ferryman I hope to see him one day hanged upon a
hill        Exit Ferryman

Shakebag See how the sun hath cleared the foggy mist
Now we have missed the mark of our intent

Here enters Greene Mosbie and Alice

Mosbie Black Will and Shakebag what make you here
What is the deed done is Arden dead

Will What could a blinded man perform in arms
Saw you not how till now the sky was dark        
That neither horse nor man could be discerned
Yet did we hear their horses as they passed

Greene Have they escaped you then and passed the ferry

Shakebag Ay for a while but here we two will stay
And at their coming back meet with them once more
Zounds I was neer so toiled in all my life
In following so slight a task as this

Mosbie How camst thou so berayed

Will With making false footing in the dark
He needs would follow them without a guide        

Alice Heres to pay for a fire and good cheer
Get you to Feversham to the Flowerdeluce
And rest yourselves until some other time

Greene Let me alone it most concerns my state

Will Ay Mistress Arden this will serve the turn
In case we fall into a second fog

      Exeunt Greene Will and Shakebag

Mosbie These knaves will never do it let us give it over

Alice First tell me how you like my new device
Soon when my husband is returning back
You and I both marching arm in arm        
Like loving friends well meet him on the way
And boldly beard and brave him to his teeth
When words grow hot and blows begin to rise
Ill call those cutters forth your tenement
Who in a manner to take up the fray
Shall wound my husband Hornsby to the death

Mosbie A fine device why this deserves a kiss

        Exeunt

IV iii  Hock Monday followed the second Sunday after
Easter See Brands Popular Antiquities

IV iii  Our poet blackens Mosbie for the same reason that
he whitewashes Arden eg Master Arden both then and at other
times had been greatly provoked by Mosbie to fight with him but
he would not Mosby at the first would not agree to that
cowardly murdering of himHolinshed


SCENE IV

The open country

Here enters Dick Reede and a Sailor

Sailor Faith Dick Reede it is to little end
His conscience is too liberal and he too niggardly
To part from any thing may do thee good

Reede He is coming from Shorlow as I understand
Here Ill intercept him for at his house
He never will vouchsafe to speak with me
If prayers and fair entreaties will not serve
Or make no battery in his flinty breast

Here enters Franklin Arden and Michael

Ill curse the carle and see what that will do
See where he comes to further my intent        
Master Arden I am now bound to the sea
My coming to you was about the plat
Of ground which wrongfully you detain from me
Although the rent of it be very small
Yet it will help my wife and children
Which here I leave in Feversham God knows
Needy and bare for Christs sake let them have it

Arden Franklin hearest thou this fellow speak
That which he craves I dearly bought of him
Although the rent of it was ever mine        
Sirrah you that ask these questions
If with thy clamorous impeaching tongue
Thou rail on me as I have heard thou dost
Ill lay thee up so close a twelvemonths day
As thou shalt neither see the sun nor moon
Look to it for as surely as I live
Ill banish pity if thou use me thus

Reede What wilt thou do me wrong and threat me too
Nay then Ill tempt thee Arden do thy worst
God I beseech thee show some miracle        
On thee or thine in plaguing thee for this
That plot of ground which thou detains from me
I speak it in an agony of spirit
Be ruinous and fatal unto thee
Either there be butchered by thy dearest friends
Or else be brought for men to wonder at
Or thou or thine miscarry in that place
Or there run mad and end thy cursd days

Franklin Fie bitter knave bridle thine envious tongue
For curses are like arrows shot upright        
Which falling down light on the shooters head

Reede Light where they will Were I upon the sea
As oft I have in many a bitter storm
And saw a dreadful southern flaw at hand
The pilot quaking at the doubtful storm
And all the sailors praying on their knees
Even in that fearful time would I fall down
And ask of God whateer betide of me
Vengeance on Arden or some misevent
To show the world what wrong the carle hath done
This charge Ill leave with my distressful wife        
My children shall be taught such prayers as these
And thus I go but leave my curse with thee

        Exeunt Reede and Sailor

Arden It is the railingest knave in Christendom
And oftentimes the villain will be mad
It greatly matters not what he says
But I assure you I neer did him wrong

Franklin I think so Master Arden

Arden Now that our horses are gone home before
My wife may haply meet me on the way        
For God knows she is grown passing kind of late
And greatly changed from
The old humour of her wonted frowardness
And seeks by fair means to redeem old faults

Franklin Happy the change that alters for the best
But see in any case you make no speech
Of the cheer we had at my Lord Cheinys
Although most bounteous and liberal
For that will make her think herself more wronged
In that we did not carry her along        
For sure she grieved that she was left behind

Arden Come Franklin let us strain to mend our pace
And take her unawares playing the cook

Here enters Alice and Mosbie

For I believe shell strive to mend our cheer

Franklin Why theres no better creatures in the world
Than women are when they are in good humours

Arden Who is that Mosbie what so familiar
Injurious strumpet and thou ribald knave
Untwine those arms

Alice Ay with a sugared kiss let them untwine        

Arden Ah Mosbie perjured beast bear this and all

Mosbie And yet no horned beast the horns are thine

Franklin O monstrous Nay then it is time to draw

Alice Help help they murder my husband

Here enters Will and Shakebag

Shakebag Zounds who injures Master Mosbie Help Will I am hurt

Mosbie I may thank you Mistress Arden for this wound

        Exeunt Mosbie Will and Shakebag

Alice Ah Arden what folly blinded thee
Ah jealous harebrained man what hast thou done
When we to welcome thee with intended sport
Came lovingly to meet thee on thy way        
Thou drewst thy sword enraged with jealousy
And hurt thy friend whose thoughts were free from harm
All for a worthless kiss and joining arms
Both done but merrily to try thy patience
And me unhappy that devised the jest
Which though begun in sport yet ends in blood

Franklin Marry God defend me from such a jest

Alice Couldst thou not see us friendly smile on thee
When we joined arms and when I kissed his cheek
Hast thou not lately found me overkind        
Didst thou not hear me cry they murder thee
Called I not help to set my husband free
No ears and all were witched ah me accursed
To link in liking with a frantic man
Henceforth Ill be thy slave no more thy wife
For with that name I never shall content thee
If I be merry thou straightways thinks me light
If sad thou sayest the sullens trouble me
If well attired thou thinks I will be gadding
If homely I seem sluttish in thine eye        
Thus am I still and shall be while I die
Poor wench abused by thy misgovernment

Arden But is it for truth that neither thou nor he
Intendedst malice in your misdemeanour

Alice The heavens can witness of our harmless thoughts

Arden Then pardon me sweet Alice and forgive this fault
Forget but this and never see the like
Impose me penance and I will perform it
For in thy discontent I find a death
A death tormenting more than death itself        

Alice Nay hadst thou loved me as thou dost pretend
Thou wouldst have marked the speeches of thy friend
Who going wounded from the place he said
His skin was pierced only through my device
And if sad sorrow taint thee for this fault
Thou wouldst have followed him and seen him dressed
And cried him mercy whom thou hast misdone
Neer shall my heart be eased till this be done

Arden Content thee sweet Alice thou shalt have thy will
Whateer it be For that I injured thee         
And wronged my friend shame scourgeth my offence
Come thou thyself and go along with me
And be a mediator twixt us two

Franklin Why Master Arden know you what you do
Will you follow him that hath dishonoured you

Alice Why canst thou prove I have been disloyal

Franklin Why Mosbie taunted your husband with the horn

Alice Ay after he had reviled him
By the injurious name of perjured beast
He knew no wrong could spite a jealous man        
More than the hateful naming of the horn

Franklin Suppose tis true yet is it dangerous
To follow him whom he hath lately hurt

Alice A fault confessed is more than half amends
But men of such ill spirit as yourself
Work crosses and debates twixt man and wife

Arden I pray thee gentle Franklin hold thy peace
I know my wife counsels me for the best
Ill seek out Mosbie where his wound is dressed
And salve this hapless quarrel if I may        

        Exeunt Arden and Alice

Franklin He whom the devil drives must go perforce
Poor gentleman how soon he is bewitched
And yet because his wife is the instrument
His friends must not be lavish in their speech

        Exit Franklin

SCENE I

A Street in Feversham

Here enters Will Shakebag and Greene

Will Sirrah Greene when was I so long in killing a man

Greene I think we shall never do it let us give it over

Shakebag Nay Zounds well kill him though we be
hanged at his door for our labour

Will Thou knowest Greene that I have lived in London
this twelve years where I have made some go
upon wooden legs for taking the wall on me divers
with silver noses for saying There goes Black Will
I have cracked as many blades as thou hast nuts

Greene O monstrous lie        

Will Faith in a manner I have The bawdyhouses
have paid me tribute there durst not a whore set
up unless she have agreed with me first for opening
her shopwindows For a cross word of a tapster
I have pierced one barrel after another with my
dagger and held him by the ears till all his beer
hath run out In Thames Street a brewers cart
was like to have run over me I made no more ado
but went to the clerk and cut all the notches of his
tallies and beat them about his head I and my
company have taken the constable from his watch
and carried him about the fields on a coltstaff I
have broken a sergeants head with his own mace
and bailed whom I list with my sword and buckler
All the tenpennyalehousesmen would stand every
morning with a quartpot in their hand saying
Will it please your worship drink He that had
not done so had been sure to have had his sign
pulled down and his lattice borne away the next
night To conclude what have I not done yet
cannot do this doubtless he is preserved by
miracle        

Here enters Alice and Michael

Greene Hence Will here comes Mistress Arden

Alice Ah gentle Michael art thou sure theyre friends

Michael Why I saw them when they both shook hands
When Mosbie bled he even wept for sorrow
And railed on Franklin that was cause of all
No sooner came the surgeon in at doors
But my master took to his purse and gave him money
And to conclude sent me to bring you word        
That Mosbie Franklin Bradshaw Adam Fowle
With divers of his neighbours and his friends
Will come and sup with you at our house this night

Alice Ah gentle Michael run thou back again
And when my husband walks into the fair
Bid Mosbie steal from him and come to me
And this night shall thou and Susan be made sure

Michael Ill go tell him

Alice And as thou goest tell John cook of our guests
And bid him lay it on spare for no cost        

        Exit Michael

Will Nay and there be such cheer we will bid ourselves
Mistress Arden Dick Greene and I do mean to sup with you

Alice And welcome shall you be Ah gentlemen
How missed you of your purpose yesternight

Greene Twas long of Shakebag that unlucky villain

Shakebag Thou dost me wrong I did as much as any

Will Nay then Mistress Arden Ill tell you how it was
When he should have locked with both his hilts
He in a bravery flourished oer his head
With that comes Franklin at him lustily        
And hurts the slave with that he slinks away

Now his way had been to have come hand and feet
one and two round at his costard he like a fool
bears his swordpoint half a yard out of danger
I lie here for my life if the devil come and he
have no more strength than I have fence he shall
never beat me from this ward Ill stand to it a
buckler in a skilful hand is as good as a castle
nay tis better than a sconce for I have tried it        
Mosbie perceiving this began to faint
With that comes Arden with his arming sword
And thrust him through the shoulder in a trice

Alice Ay but I wonder why you both stood still

Will Faith I was so amazed I could not strike

Alice Ah sirs had he yesternight been slain
For every drop of his detested blood
I would have crammed in angels in thy fist
And kissed thee too and hugged thee in my arms

Will Patient yourself we cannot help it now        
Greene and we two will dog him through the fair
And stab him in the crowd and steal away

Here enters Mosbie

Alice It is unpossible but here comes he
That will I hope invent some surer means
Sweet Mosbie hide thy arm it kills my heart

Mosbie Ay Mistress Arden this is your favour

Alice Ah say not so for when I saw thee hurt
I could have took the weapon thou letst fall
And run at Arden for I have sworn
That these mine eyes offended with his sight        
Shall never close till Ardens be shut up
This night I rose and walked about the chamber
And twice or thrice I thought to have murdered him

Mosbie What in the night then had we been undone

Alice Why how long shall he live

Mosbie Faith Alice no longer than this night
Black Will and Shakebag will you two perform
The complot that I have laid

Will Ay or else think me a villain

Greene And rather than you shall want Ill help myself

Mosbie You Master Greene shall single Franklin forth
And hold him with a long tale of strange news        
That he may not come home till suppertime
Ill fetch Master Arden home and we like friends
Will play a game or two at tables here

Alice But what of all this how shall he be slain

Mosbie Why Black Will and Shakebag locked within the countinghouse
Shall at a certain watchword given rush forth

Will What shall the watchword be

Mosbie Now I take you that shall be the word        
But come not forth before in any case

Will I warrant you But who shall lock me in

Alice That will I do thoust keep the key thyself

Mosbie Come Master Greene go you along with me
See all things ready Alice against we come

Alice Take no care for that send you him home

        Exeunt Mosbie and Greene

And if he eer go forth again blame me
Come Black Will that in mine eyes art fair
Next unto Mosbie do I honour thee
Instead of fair words and large promises      
My hands shall play you golden harmony
How like you this say will you do it sirs

Will Ay and that bravely too Mark my device
Place Mosbie being a stranger in a chair
And let your husband sit upon a stool
That I may come behind him cunningly
And with a towel pull him to the ground
Then stab him till his flesh be as a sieve
That done bear him behind the Abbey
That those that find him murdered may suppose      
Some slave or other killed him for his gold

Alice A fine device you shall have twenty pound
And when he is dead you shall have forty more
And lest you might be suspected staying here
Michael shall saddle you two lusty geldings
Ride whither you will to Scotland or to Wales
Ill see you shall not lack whereer you be

Will Such words would make one kill a thousand men
Give me the key which is the countinghouse

Alice Here would I stay and still encourage you      
But that I know how resolute you are

Shakebag Tush you are too fainthearted we must do it

Alice But Mosbie will be there whose very looks
Will add unwonted courage to my thought
And make me the first that shall adventure on him

Will Tush get you gone tis we must do the deed
When this door opens next look for his death

      Exeunt Will and Shakebag

Alice Ah would he now were here that it might open
I shall no more be closed in Ardens arms
That like the snakes of black Tisiphone      
Sting me with their embracings Mosbies arms
Shall compass me and were I made a star
I would have none other spheres but those
There is no nectar but in Mosbies lips
Had chaste Diana kissed him she like me
Would grow lovesick and from her watery bower
Fling down Endymion and snatch him up
Then blame not me that slay a silly man
Not half so lovely as Endymion

Here enters Michael

Michael Mistress my master is coming hard by      

Alice Who comes with him

Michael Nobody but Mosbie

Alice Thats well Michael Fetch in the tables and
when thou hast done stand before the countinghouse door

Michael Why so

Alice Black Will is locked within to do the deed

Michael What shall he die tonight

Alice Ay Michael

Michael But shall not Susan know it

Alice Yes for shell be as secret as ourselves      

Michael Thats brave Ill go fetch the tables

Alice But Michael hark to me a word or two
When my husband is come in lock the streetdoor
He shall be murdered or the guests come in

      Exit Michael

Here enters Arden and Mosbie

Husband what mean you to bring Mosbie home
Although I wished you to be reconciled
Twas more for fear of you than love of him
Black Will and Greene are his companions
And they are cutters and may cut you short
Therefore I thought it good to make you friends      
But wherefore do you bring him hither now
You have given me my supper with his sight

Mosbie Master Arden methinks your wife would have me gone

Arden No good Master Mosbie women will be prating
Alice bid him welcome he and I are friends

Alice You may enforce me to it if you will
But I had rather die than bid him welcome
His company hath purchased me ill friends
And therefore will I neer frequent it more

MosbieOh how cunningly she can dissemble      

Arden Now he is here you will not serve me so

Alice I pray you be not angry or displeased
Ill bid him welcome seeing youll have it so
You are welcome Master Mosbie will you sit down

Mosbie I know I am welcome to your loving husband
But for yourself you speak not from your heart

Alice And if I do not sir think I have cause

Mosbie Pardon me Master Arden Ill away

Arden No good Master Mosbie

Alice We shall have guests enough though you go hence      

Mosbie I pray you Master Arden let me go

Arden I pray thee Mosbie let her prate her fill

Alice The doors are open sir you may be gone

MichaelNay thats a lie for I have locked the doors

Arden Sirrah fetch me a cup of wine Ill make them friends
And gentle Mistress Alice seeing you are so stout
You shall begin frown not Ill have it so

Alice I pray you meddle with that you have to do

Arden Why Alice how can I do too much for him
Whose life I have endangered without cause      

Alice Tis true and seeing twas partly through my means
I am content to drink to him for this once
Here Master Mosbie and I pray you henceforth
Be you as strange to me as I to you
Your company hath purchased me ill friends
And I for you God knows have undeserved
Been ill spoken of in every place
Therefore henceforth frequent my house no more

Mosbie Ill see your husband in despite of you
Yet Arden I protest to thee by heaven         
Thou neer shalt see me more after this night
Ill go to Rome rather than be forsworn

Arden Tush Ill have no such vows made in my house

Alice Yes I pray you husband let him swear
And on that condition Mosbie pledge me here

Mosbie Ay as willingly as I mean to live

Arden Come Alice is our supper ready yet

Alice It will by then you have played a game at tables

Arden Come Master Mosbie what shall we play for

Mosbie Three games for a French crown sir and please you

Arden Marry sir theres two for failing

Mosbie Ah Master Arden now I can take you

Arden Mosbie Michael Alice what will you do

Will Nothing but take you up sir nothing else      

Mosbie Theres for the pressing iron you told me of Stabs him

Shakebag And theres for the ten pound in my sleeve Stabs him

Take this for hindering Mosbies love and mine      She stabs him

Michael O mistress

Will Ah that villain will betray us all

Mosbie Tush fear him not he will be secret

Michael Why dost thou think I will betray myself

Shakebag In Southwark dwells a bonny northern lass
The widow Chambly Ill to her house now      
And if she will not give me harborough

Will Shift for yourselves we two will leave you now

      Exeunt Franklin Mosbie and Greene

Mosbie That is the next way to betray myself

Greene Alas Mistress Arden the watch will take me hers
And cause suspicion where else would be none

But first convey the body to the fields

Greene Be resolute Mistress Alice betray us not      
But cleave to us as we will stick to you

Alice Ah by whom Master Franklin can you tell

Franklin I know not but behind the Abbey
There he lies murdered in most piteous case

Mayor But Master Franklin are you sure tis he

Franklin I am too sure would God I were deceived

Alice Find out the murderers let them be known

Franklin Ay so they shall come you along with us

Alice Wherefore      

Franklin Know you this handtowel and this knife

SusanAh Michael through this thy negligence
Thou hast betrayed and undone us all

MichaelI was so afraid I knew not what I did
I thought I had thrown them both into the well

Alice It is the pigs blood we had to supper
But wherefore stay you find out the murderers

Mayor I fear me youll prove one of them yourself

Alice I one of them what mean such questions

Franklin I fear me he was murdered in this house      
And carried to the fields for from that place
Backwards and forwards may you see
The print of many feet within the snow
And look about this chamber where we are
And you shall find part of his guiltless blood
For in his slipshoe did I find some rushes
Which argueth he was murdered in this room

Mayor Look in the place where he was wont to sit
See see his blood it is too manifest

Alice It is a cup of wine that Michael shed      

Michael Ay truly

Franklin It is his blood which strumpet thou hast shed
But if I live thou and thy complices
Which have conspired and wrought his death shall rue it

Alice Ah Master Franklin God and heaven can tell
I loved him more than all the world beside
But bring me to him let me see his body

Franklin Bring that villain and Mosbies sister too
And one of you go to the Flowerdeluce
And seek for Mosbie and apprehend him too             

      Exeunt

V i  Hilts is common for hilt eg in Malory and Shakespeare
both his hilts is apparently an extension of this use
Locked I take to mean crossed or clashed swords with his
adversary

V i  game or two at tables a sort of backgammon

V i  Cf the concluding lines of Ovids Elegy already
alluded to i 

V i  Cecily Pounders did help to bear the dead corpse out
into a meadow there commonly called the Amery CroftWardmote
Book


SCENE II

An obscure street in London

Here enters Shakebag solus

Shakebag The widow Chambly in her husbands days I kept
And now hes dead she is grown so stout
She will not know her old companions
I came thither thinking to have had harbour
As I was wont
And she was ready to thrust me out at doors
But whether she would or no I got me up
And as she followed me I spurned her down the stairs
And broke her neck and cut her tapsters throat
And now I am going to fling them in the Thames
I have the gold what care I though it be known
Ill cross the water and take sanctuary

      Exit


SCENE III

Ardens House at Feversham

Here enters the Mayor Mosbie Alice Franklin
Michael and Susan

Mayor See Mistress Arden where your husband lies
Confess this foul fault and be penitent

Alice Arden sweet husband what shall I say
The more I sound his name the more he bleeds
This blood condemns me and in gushing forth
Speaks as it falls and asks me why I did it
Forgive me Arden I repent me now
And would my death save thine thou shouldst not die
Rise up sweet Arden and enjoy thy love
And frown not on me when we meet in heaven      
In heaven Ill love thee though on earth I did not

Mayor Say Mosbie what made thee murder him

Franklin Study not for an answer look not down
His purse and girdle found at thy beds head
Witness sufficiently thou didst the deed
It bootless is to swear thou didst it not

Mosbie I hired Black Will and Shakebag ruffians both
And they and I have done this murderous deed
But wherefore stay we Come and bear me hence

Franklin Those ruffians shall not escape I will up to London      
And get the Councils warrant to apprehend them

      Exeunt


SCENE IV

The Kentish Coast

Here enters Will

Will Shakebag I hear hath taken sanctuary
But I am so pursued with hues and cries
For petty robberies that I have done
That I can come unto no sanctuary
Therefore must I in some oysterboat
At last be fain to go on board some hoy
And so to Flushing There is no staying here
At Sittingburgh the watch was like to take me
And had not I with my buckler covered my head
And run full blank at all adventures                 
I am sure I had neer gone further than that place
For the constable had twenty warrants to apprehend me
Besides that I robbed him and his man once at Gadshill
Farewell England Ill to Flushing now

      Exit Will

V iv  Faversham was famous for its oysters


SCENE V

Justiceroom at Feversham

Here enters the Mayor Mosbie Alice Michael Susan
and Bradshaw

Mayor Come make haste and bring away the prisoners

Bradshaw Mistress Arden you are now going to God
And I am by the law condemned to die
About a letter I brought from Master Greene
I pray you Mistress Arden speak the truth
Was I ever privy to your intent or no

Alice What should I say You brought me such a letter
But I dare swear thou knewest not the contents
Leave now to trouble me with worldly things
And let me meditate upon my saviour Christ       
Whose blood must save me for the blood I shed

Mosbie How long shall I live in this hell of grief
Convey me from the presence of that strumpet

Alice Ah but for thee I had never been a strumpet
What cannot oaths and protestations do
When men have opportunity to woo
I was too young to sound thy villainies
But now I find it and repent too late

Susan Ah gentle brother wherefore should I die
I knew not of it till the deed was done             

Mosbie For thee I mourn more than for myself
But let it suffice I cannot save thee now

Michael And if your brother and my mistress
Had not promised me you in marriage
I had neer given consent to this foul deed

Mayor Leave to accuse each other now
And listen to the sentence I shall give
Bear Mosbie and his sister to London straight
Where they in Smithfield must be executed
Bear Mistress Arden unto Canterbury             
Where her sentence is she must be burnt
Michael and Bradshaw in Feversham must suffer death

Alice Let my death make amends for all my sins

Mosbie Fie upon women this shall be my song
But bear me hence for I have lived too long

Susan Seeing no hope on earth in heaven is my hope

Michael Faith I care not seeing I die with Susan

Bradshaw My blood be on his head that gave the sentence

Mayor To speedy execution with them all      Exeunt

V v  For the charges of brenning Mistress Arden and
execution of George Bradshaw XLIII SCanterbury Records


SCENE VI

Here enters Franklin

Franklin Thus have you seen the truth of Ardens death
As for the ruffians Shakebag and Black Will
The one took sanctuary and being sent for out
Was murdered in Southwark as he passed
To Greenwich where the Lord Protector lay
Black Will was burned in Flushing on a stage
Greene was hanged at Osbridge in Kent
The painter fled and how he died we know not
But this above the rest is to be noted
Arden lay murdered in that plot of ground          
Which he by force and violence held from Reede
And in the grass his bodys print was seen
Two years and more after the deed was done
Gentlemen we hope youll pardon this naked tragedy
Wherein no fild points are foisted in
To make it gracious to the ear or eye
For simple truth is gracious enough
And needs no other points of glosing stuff      Exit

V vi  By the Wardmote Book George Loosebagg ie
Shakebag escaped at that time John Green who like Mosbie
was a tailor was taken in July in Cornwall and brought to Faversham
and hanged in chains within the liberties Susan in the
play combines the characters of Cecily Pounder Mosbies sister
and of Elizabeth Stafford the maidservant Morsby and his
sister were hanged in Smithfield Michael Saunderson was drawn
and hanged in chains in Faversham where Elizabeth was burnt
By the Wardmote Book Alice Arden did not stab her husband
