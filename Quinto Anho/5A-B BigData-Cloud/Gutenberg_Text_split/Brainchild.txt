                   Ron definitely didnt like what
                 had happened But who can blame him
                  How would you like to wake and find

Ron Carvers day was beginning strangely

For one thing the legs he swung off the narrow bed wouldnt touch the
floor And his hands whose ten strong fingers could manipulate the
controls of any ship ever launched into space were weak and clumsy

He looked at the hands first looked at them for a long time Then he
screamed

He screamed until footsteps were loud in the corridor outside his room
shrill piping screams that didnt stop even when the giant womanface
was bending over him speaking gentle soothing words stroking his
thin shoulders with giant comforting gestures

There there now the woman was saying Youre all right Ronnie
Youre all right It was only a nightmare a bad old nightmare

She was right Only the nightmare hadnt ended The nightmare was
before his face in her gargantuan features in her motherly touch on
his frail body in the sight of the small soft appendages that were
his hands

They were the hands of a boy of twelve And Ron Carver was thirty years
old

Two men giants joined the woman at his bedside and one of them forced
a small speckled capsule past his resisting lips Then his viewpoint
became detached and distant and a pleasurable drowsiness overcame him
He stretched out and shut his eyes but he could still hear the worried
tones of their speech

Dr Minton warned us one of the men said lifting Rons bony wrist
and feeling for the pulse The boy has suffered some severe traumatic
shock

Dr Minton Ron Carvers mind grasped the familiar namethe name of
his own physiciangratefully But his body gave no sign

Maybe we better call him the woman said nervously I think hes
still in the sick bay

Good idea

In another moment a familiar hairy face was floating over Rons head
like a captive balloon a face grown grotesque in size

Doctor he said with his lips

There Dr Minton patted his shoulder Youre all right now Ronnie
Youre perfectly all right Just relax and try to sleep The balloon
came closer and the scraggly ends of the doctors beard brushed his
cheek Then the doctors mouth was covering his small ear

Play the game the doctor whispered For your own sake Play the
game Ron

Then he was asleep

                                   

He awoke to the sound of running feet He sat up in bed and looked
towards the door of the small white room in which he was confined It
was partly open and the sound of clattering soles and shrill young
voices came through clearly

The door slammed open startling him A hoydenish youngster gaped at
him There was a flat lock of reddish hair over his forehead and his
face was freckled

Hoy he said Whats the matter with you

Ron stared back wordlessly

You sick or something the boy said edging into the room

No His own voice strange and reedy frightened him No Im all
right

Andy A tall man with a frowning face appeared behind the boy Come
on fella Lets not waste any time He looked at Ron You the new
chap

Yes

Feel well enough for some breakfast

I guess so

Fine Then get some clothes on and come along

Hoy the frecklefaced boy said curiously You play airball

Thats enough of that The man paddled the boys rump Get along
Andy Youll have plenty of time to get acquainted later

The boy giggled and ran down the hall Ron got out of bed slowly and
walked towards the undersized clothing that was draped on a nearby
chair He slipped into a gray coverall and said Listencan I talk to
you

The man looked at his watch Well  all right I suppose But only
for a minute I promised the boys a game this morning Im Mr Larkin
the athletic director

Ron hesitated Mr Larkin Iwhere am I

Dont you know Even the mans smile was half a frown Youre at
Roverwood Home for Boys Didnt they tell you that

No Ron said carefully II dont seem to remember very much How I
got here I mean

Dr Minton brought you in last evening Hes one of our directors

Oh Ron laced on the tiny scuffed shoes And wheres Dr Minton now

Gone back to the city Hes a busy man Hear theyve got him working
on some big government project Well come on Ronnie Breakfasts
waiting

Yes sir Ron Carver said

He followed the tall man down the hall having trouble guiding the
short stumpy legs that were now his own They entered a communal dining
room filled with the clatter of dishes and the laughter of boys He
was brought to a long table and seated beside Larkin The other boys
greeted him with only mild interest but the frecklefaced youth at the
other end dropped him a broad wink

He ate sparingly choking on the food his mind working It was the
longest nightmare of his life and the moment of awakening seemed too
far off for comfort

Then Larkin was standing up and rattling a spoon against a water glass

Fellas he said all those interested in this mornings airball
game will assemble on the field in half an hour after breakfast Please
dont volunteer unless youre able to handle a PF Everybody else is
invited to see the game

He sat down amid cheers He smiled sadly at Ron and asked How about
you Ronnie Can you operate a PF

Of course he answered without thinking Hed been using Personal
Flyers since he was old enough to dream about flight On his tenth
birthday his father had bought him one of the earliest models a
cumbersome machine then called a platform Since that day he
had become familiar with every manmade thing that flew from the
doublerotored PFs to the sixtyrocket space liners

Fine Larkin said cheerfully Then maybe youd like to play the
game

Ron Carver looked up sharply Play the game

Sure Mr Larkin he said forcing his eagerness

Half an hour later they were assembled on the huge lawn outside of the
main building of Roverwood Home for Boys The long row of PFs looking
like chromeplate potbellied stoves gleamed in the morning sun The
boys began to run when they saw their Flyers and Ron found his arm
taken by the freckled youth who had entered his room

Hoy he said Follow me Ill pick you out a lively one

The redhead clambered inside a machine marked Seven and Ronnie
followed his instructions by choosing the vehicle marked Nine They
secured themselves inside and tested the jet tube set in front of the
Flyer The boys took off from the ground in perfect unison the redhead
bellowing out an introduction over the sound of the wind roaring past
their ears

The PFs descended on a blast from Mr Larkins whistle congregating
in the center of the field Teams were chosen and Andy was picked as
Captain of the Odds A coin was tossed to decide the playing sequence
and they were ready

Larkin released the first airball and the two teams streamed up after
it Andy gunned the engine and reached the ball first He sent it
scooting thirty yards ahead of him with the blast of the airjet pipe
but a member of the Evens team was there to veer it off to the left
Another Evens man a burly youth of fourteen took command of it
neatly getting the airball in the sight of his airjet and corkscrewing
it towards the goalpost Ron had grown too old before the game of
airball had become popular with the nations youngsters but he had
seen enough action to have learned some tricks He pointed his PF
directly for the Even machine and kept coming The burly youth looked
up startled at the onslaught and pulled his Flyer away The fact that
the PFs were magnetically collisionproof didnt matter it was pure
instinct Ron captured the ball in his airjet pipe and shouted for
Andy to block his path towards the goal

The Odds scored and the two teams descended for a rest Andy the
grin wide on his brownspotted face said Youre okay Ronnie Hoy I
mean it Youre okay

Thanks Ron said He found himself panting

The game resumed It ended in a  score favor of the Odds Andy and
Ron were cheered as they left the Flyers and headed for the communal
showers of the Roverwood Home for Boys

In the stall Ron Carver looked down at the spindly frame that was now
his body and began to weep Andy heard him but said nothing Then
they dressed and ambled back to the main house sharing the awkward
silence of new friends

Finally the older boy said I dont mean to butt in Ronnie But is
somethin the matter

II dont know Andy Im all mixed up I dont even know how I got
here

Thats easy Dr Minton brought you

But where is he now Andy Dr Minton Its very important that I see
him

Andy shrugged Not much chance of that Dr Minton only comes around
once twice a year

But I have to see him Right away Will they call him for me

Gosh I dont think so Hes some kind of big shot in the government
now

They flopped on the grass and Andy tore out a ragged clump and chewed
on it blankly Ron said Andy Im in trouble I need some help

No kidding

Yes He brought his voice to a whisper Andywhat if I told you
that I was really He stopped and examined the open innocent face
in front of his eyes He knew that it would be useless to tell the
truth Skip it he said

I dont get you Whats on your mind Ronnie

Nothing Andy I just have to get away from here

But you cant I mean not until they let you Its the rules

Andyhow long have you been here

The boy thought a moment Almost nine years he said blissfully
Since my folks got killed

How long do you have to stay

Why til Im old enough to work Eighteen I guess

Only six years to go Ron thought sourly

He stood up

Andywhere do they put the PFs

In the shed

Is it possible to get one out

Course not Only when we play the game

And when will we play another game

Dunno Tomorrow maybe Its Sunday

Play the game Ron said to himself

                                   

The Evens team member caught the spinning gasfilled airball in the
path of his airjet and kept it moving in front of his Flyer Andy was
after him in a flash shouting for Ron to join him But Rons daring
tactics of yesterday seemed to have deserted him He steered the PF out
of the path of the Evens man and the goal was scored

On the ground Andy said Whats the trouble Ronnie Didnt you hear
me

Yes I heard you Andy listen Im taking off

Sure in just a minute the freckled boy said But look the next
time you see me cut across the

You dont understand Ron said intensely Im running away

What

Larkins whistle sounded the signal to resume play The airball shot
into the sky and the two teams sped after it Andy was late getting
started He looked at Ron and gasped You cant do that

But Ron Carver was already in flight and his PF was heading away from
the center of the action heading over the jagged pinetree tops that
surrounded the Roverwood Home for Boys heading for the misty green
hills beyond

Larkin saw what was happening and he blew his whistle shrilly The
teams descended thinking a foul had been called Larkin shouted a
command towards the burly youth who had played so aggressively the day
before but then realized it was far too late to stop the swift passage
of the PF now disappearing behind the trees

                                   

Ron dropped the PF to earth as soon as his eyes spotted the first sign
of a settled community He landed the small machine in the shadow of
a hillside and dragged it into the thick underbrush for concealment
Then he trekked to the main highway until he reached a road sign that
informed him of his location He was in a town called Spring Harbor
just fifteen miles outside of the city

He looked down at the waxy newness of his gray Roverwood coverall and
wondered if it was a familiar uniform to the residents But he had to
take the chance He covered the cloth with dust and rolled up the
trouser legs almost to his knees Then he broke off a long branch from
a sapling and used it as a walking stick Casually he strolled into
the town proper

The pose worked Some people on the porches looked after him with mild
curiosity but no one stopped him Then he paused at a gas station
and asked the owner of the automatic pump if there was transportation
available to the city

The owner scratched his face and looked at the boy curiously Ron told
a plausible story about being separated from a scouting group and the
man seemed satisfied He had a pickup copter going into the city at
ten oclock he invited Ron to wait inside his house and even served
him a sandwich

The copter pilot a genial redfaced man asked him some gentle
questions Ron answered them guardedly and told him that his
destination was Fordham Terrace The copter dropped him on the rooftop
of the massive office building and the pilot left with a friendly wave
of his hand

When he was gone Ron rolled down his trouser legs brushed his uniform
clean and descended to the fourteenth floor of the building He
walked rapidly along the corridors until he came to the door marked

                        WILFRED G MINTON MD

He rattled the knob When he found the door locked he let out an adult
oath It was Sunday of course Dr Minton wouldnt be in on Sunday
And Ron had never known his home address

He returned to the elevator and went to the ground floor There was an
information booth and the woman behind the glass was a motherly type
Her eyes softened at his approach

Dr Minton she said lifting an eyebrow Why I guess I do have his
address But who sent you young man

Nobody Ron said I was supposed to see him thats all

She kept her eyes on his face while her hand leafed through the
directory on her desk Of course Dr Minton doesnt use his office
anymore He gave up his practice here almost a year ago He was put on
an important government project Dr Jurgens his assistant handles
all his patients now Would you like Dr Jurgens number

No Ron said Please I must see Dr Minton

All right But I dont know if you can see him without an appointment
Hes staying at the Government Medical Center in Washington She
smiled Thats a long way for a little boy

Thank you Ron said curtly and walked off

His mind was racing tripping over his thoughts A year ago But
that was impossible It seemed only days since he had returned from
Andromeda after a fiveyear absence One of his first visits had been
to Dr Mintons officenot just to renew an old friendship but to
allow the physician to examine him thoroughly for traces of the varied
and deadly diseases that man was subject to on alien worlds Could it
have been a whole year ago Where had he spent the time between And
what had happened to give him the body of a twelveyearold child

He fought off the questions He had no time for the puzzle now there
werent enough pieces to make sense He had only one thought to find
the doctor

But that was a major problem all by itself Washington was a good hour
away by fast copter service And in this big suspicious city it
wouldnt be as easy to obtain free transport to his destination He
could do nothingnot without money

When he thought of money he thought of Adrian

Adrian

Of course Adrian would know what to do next Adrian always seemed to
know what to do Her fathers money had opened every conceivable door
in this city and she herself had often suggested that it open doors
for him Doors to the executive heights of the Space Transport Company
Doors to the plush offices in the sky tower doors to the select circle
of cigarsmoking men who controlled the transportation empire of
which Ron had been only a spare part But Ron Carver had been young
he thought now sourly and his head had been stuffed with ideals He
detested the groundworms who stayed home and counted the profits of
space travel He wanted the stars

So he had become a pilot one of the best in her fathers fleet She
had sworn at him for his decision and turned away from his embrace
But on the night of their parting the night before the dawn ascent
towards the speck of light that was Andromeda she had softened and
cried in his arms

He thought now of that moment and his small fingers rolled into fists

Adrian he thought I must go to her

The doorman was magnificent and imposing in his braided uniform but
his eyes were cold when he saw Ron

What do you want son

II have a message for Miss Walder Its very important

Okay son You just give your message to me

No Im supposed to deliver it in person

The doorman grunted Wait a minute He put in a call to the penthouse
apartment The idea of a twelveyearold visitor must have amused the
girl He brought back an invitation for Ron to enter her home

Ron stepped off the elevator and his stomach was churning What would
she say when she saw him Would she believe his story Would she help
him find an answer

Adrian came to the door herself and the amusement was evident on her
long smoothlyplaned face Her auburn hair was swept back in Grecian
ringlets and the gown she wore was blindingly white Come in dear
she said smiling

The effect of looking up at the girl now a sort of giantess in his
eyes made Ron dizzy He swayed against the doorframe and her cool
fingers steadied him

You poor boy she crooned Come inside

She halfcarried him to the downy sofa For a full minute he was too
choked to speak She offered him a glass of milk but he asked for
water She brought some to him and he coughed

Now the girl said spreading the wide skirt over her knees just
what was it you wanted to tell me

I

Come now She smiled endearingly and brushed back the hair from his
forehead You must have had something on your mind

Yes he said at last his voice strained Yes Adrian IIm
Ron

What

Im Ron Carver No listen Im not mad Its really me Ron

She had stood up shocked Then she laughed

Adrian listen to me Something happened to me when I returned from
Andromeda I dont know what I found myself at a boys home near
Spring Harbor

Now really This is the craziest

I know its crazy He wiped his forehead in an adult gesture But
its true Adrian Ive beenchanged somehow I dont know why But
its something to do with Dr Minton

She sat down again limply Then she studied his face and for a
moment Ron thought she was seriously considering his predicament
But then the laugh started again the same slightly offkey laugh Ron
remembered

Adrian you must believe me I can prove it Just listen to me for a
moment

She stopped the laugh and grew serious her eyes caught by the
intensity of his own All right she whispered Ill listen

My name is Ronald Carver Im thirty years old Im a Captain of the
Walder Space Transport Company I have been in the Andromeda system for
the past five years I returned to Earth he stopped and swallowed
hard I dont know exactly when I went to see Dr Minton an old
friend and a physician He examined me and then

She stared fascinated

And then I was a child A child of twelve in a home for boys I ran
away from there this morning and came looking for Dr Minton Ive
been told that hes in Washington I must get to him I must find out
whats happened to me

She was shaking her head slowly eyes still fixed on his face He got
up from the sofa and came towards her His small hand reached out and
patted the fine bones of hers

You must remember he said You must believe me Adrian Remember
our last night together Right here We stood by that window and you
cried in my arms And then we

She tore her hand away as if burned Then she stood up looking
horrified

Get out of here she shrieked You little monster

Adrian Only now did he realize what it must have been like to her
to hear those words from his childish lips to feel the touch of his
tiny hand as he spoke of the night they

Get out she cried covering her face Get out before I call the
police

Adrian

She screamed piercingly This time the sound brought heavy footside
clumping outside her front door It was thrown open and a uniformed
man with bouncing epaulets was striding towards him

No Ron said You must listen

Get him out of here

Sure Miss Walder

He struggled in the big mans grip while the girl turned her head
aside He managed to squirm from his hold and broke for the door The
houseman started after him cursing Rons hand went out and grasped
a solid metal ash tray He threw it without thought or aim but it
crashed squarely into the mans face and sent him thudding to the
carpet

Adrian screamed again He looked at her once more imploringly Then he
ran for the door just before she reached for the house telephone

In the elevator cage he punched the button marked roof and fell
against the wall panting

On the rooftop he galloped across the metallic surface towards the
ledge He peered over it and his heart sank when he saw that his
stratagem had deceived no one Police were entering the building and
some were pointing fingers in his direction With a sigh he dropped to
his knees and rested his head against the cool aluminum surface

Its no use he said aloud

Then he heard the copter overhead

He looked up thinking it was a police vehicle But then he saw the
outmoded design of its fuselage and the young face at the controls

It hovered over his head and a rope ladder unfolded The youthful
pilot said Quick Climb in

He blinked at the voice unbelievingly Then he scrambled to his feet
and grabbed the dangling ladder He barely made it into the copter the
pilot had to help

Who are you he said gasping

The boy laughed I hate cops too

Then they were in the air and speeding towards the west

                                   

Ron Carver watched the back of the young boys neck for twenty minutes
while he steered the ancient copter expertly across the skies He
figured that the boy might have been fourteen or fifteen but there
was a competence in the way his hands moved over the controls and a
steeliness in the way his head sat on his thin neck

They didnt make much conversation but Ron gathered that the boy was a
member of something called the Red Rockets an organization with some
inexplicable purpose

It was only after the copter had landed on the roof of a halfdecayed
slum in the worst part of town that Ron realized who the Red Rockets
were They were kids all of them banded together for mutual defense
and in common antagonism toward the world When he clambered out of the
copter his rescuer grinned and said

This is it pal This is where the gang meets

The Red Rockets

Yeah This is Shocks house Hes the leader

They had to descend by stairs there was no building elevator When
they reached the second floor the boy put a finger to his lips and
rapped onetwo twotwo on the apartment door

A boy no older than Rons new body opened it His dark pinched face
grew smaller and darker when he saw the stranger He looked back into
the room before letting them in

The room was a study in decay Someone had once wallpapered it in an
optimistic pink pattern that was now sardonic in the surroundings The
furniture was rudimentary and there were no working light fixtures A
battery lamp was sitting in the middle of a wooden table and three
youngsters were playing with a ragged deck of cards

The tallest of them arose when the newcomers entered He was the only
one wearing a jacket the others were in shirtsleeves His hair was
black and unruly to the point of being ludicrous His wide mouth
twisted when he spoke

Whos this he said Whats the idea

Hes okay Rons protector said Hes an okay kid I spotted him on
a rooftop down on Park A million cops after him I dropped down in the
copter and picked him up

The tall boy studied Rons face Whats your name

Ron

What were the cops chasin you for

Ron hesitated Any of your business

The tall boy smiled Maybe not He looked towards the others and
winked as if pleased Guess hes okay He held his right hand out to
Ron while his left ducked into his jacket pocket My names Shock
pal And Im the leader here And just sos you dont forget it

Pain lanced through Rons arm and struck the base of his skull He
tried to free himself from the tall boys grip but his fingers
wouldnt part from the others flesh He dropped to his knees in agony
until the grip was broken

He looked up his face damp

Thats your nitiation the tall boy grinned Now you know whats
what Ronnie boy So if you want to join the Rockets youll know where
your orders come from

Shock helped him to his feet Right Ronnie boy

Ron shook his head still bewildered

Good deal Shock said Now lets finish that game You play kid

No Ron said He staggered towards a wooden chair on the side of the
room and dropped on it heavily No he repeated still trying to
regain his breath

Play the game

His rescuer sat beside him Dont mind that guy he whispered He
does that to everybody He got some kind of a power in his hands But
hes not a bad guy Honest

Sure Ron said weakly

We get a lot of kicks the boy said eagerly Youll see We have
dogfights with the other gangs With copters We only got one that
aint so much But were figurin on gettin some PFs next year if we
can collect enough dough in the treasury

Thatll be great Ron said Then he dropped his hand on the others
arm Listenis there any chance of takin a trip In the copter

Yeah sure the boy said warily Only you gotta ask for it in
advance I mean its Rocket property and you gotta sign for it And
even then if Shock wants to use itwell

Why Ron said Whys that Because hes the leader

Sure the boy said simply Thats the reason

Ron looked across the room at the card players

How do you get to be the leader

I dunno Shocks the leader cause he can lick anybody in the Rockets
That makes sense dont it

Yes I suppose so He chewed his lip Listen Lets say I was
leader Could I use the copter then Any time I wanted

Sure I mean if youre the leader whos gonna stop you

Yes Ron said He stood up and walked to the table watching the
cards as they were slapped on the wood

Hey Shock he said

The tall boy didnt look up What is it

You cheat A thrill ran through Rons new body as he said it and he
muttered a small prayer that his guess about Shocks power was correct

I what

Ive been watching you play and you cheat You dont even cheat good
You cheat sloppy

The tall boy stood up slowly and the other chairs were scraped back in
anticipation

Now thats something he said Thats really something The kids
here ten minutes and right away he wants to be buried His face
became grim Boy weve had em wise before pal But never like this

Ron planted himself in front of him

So he said

Shocks face clouded Say are you kidding You really like trouble
that bad

His right hand lashed out while the left headed for his jacket pocket
But it wasnt the right that Ron avoided Both of his short arms shot
out towards the tall boys left and stopped the descent of the arm
Shocks right hand thudded against Rons shoulder the blow only
stinging him

Hey Shock cried Hey you

It was a triumph for Ron He had been right about the electrical
circuit woven through Shocks clothing the circuit he couldnt
complete without his left hand tripping the mechanism in his pocket
With the power off Shocks weapon was useless He was caught by
surprise and Rons quickmoving hands tumbled him to the floor

Before he had a chance to do anything else Ron was upon him with an
upraised chair He closed his eyes before he swung The sound of the
crash might have sickened him in other circumstances now it sounded
good and satisfying

Ron looked around the room panting

Im the leader now he said Understand Im the leader

The looked at each other uncertainly

Im taking the copter for a while Ron said backing towards the
door Any arguments

Nobody answered

Swell So long pals

Outside the door he ran all the way back to the roof and was off
before the gang could follow

The trip took almost two hours Even Rons experienced guidance of
the controls couldnt push the old copter past its limits and he was
keeping a worried eye on the fuel gauge It was with a sigh of relief
that he dropped the vehicle atop a public parking station in the
downtown district within walking distance of the Government Medical
Center

The sun was dropping fast and the Washington streets were still filled
with Sunday sightseers who found nothing odd in the sight of a solitary
twelveyearold When he entered the enormous Ushaped edifice that
housed a hundred and one government medical projects he was thinking
fast about a plausible story for the receptionist The best he could do
was

Im looking for Dr Wilfred Minton Hehes my uncle

Dr Minton She was young and the efficient type Im sorry but
Dr Mintons been on special assignment for some time Its not easy to
locate him

Oh I know about that Ron said airily But I was supposed to see
him today You see my momhis sister that isshe was in a very bad
accident He swallowed hard wondering if he was being believed

The woman frowned Well if its an emergency I suppose I could check
with central control If its really important

Oh its important all right He said this with great conviction

Very well then She picked up her telephone and there was much
transferring from party to party Finally she lowered the receiver
saying Hes in the east wing Its Security territory so Ill have
to see about a pass

It took another ten minutes for her to locate the authority she was
seeking A young man with crinkly hair and a grim expression came
briskly to the desk asked him a few questions and then signed his
name on a document Ron put the paper into the pocket of his coveralls
and followed the man to a bank of private elevators

The man waved him inside one and he couldnt resist a wideeyed
question

Gosh mister Are you from the FBI

The man couldnt conceal a small pleased grin Thats right son Only
you keep it a secret

Sure Ron said When the door closed and the elevator ascended he
grinned too Being twelve had its advantages sometimes

He got off the elevator and a uniformed guard checked his paper and
led him into an anteroom

You wait here son he said and left

Ron waited five minutes When nothing happened he tried an adjoining
door It was open He stepped inside the next room and saw that it was
a bare room with nothing but a row of filing cabinets and an abandoned
swivel chair with a definite list to port

He went to the files and peered at the designation cards

They read

                           PROJECT SCHOLAR

He shrugged and tried to open the top file It was locked He tried
the others with no better luck

Then he heard the voices in the anteroom

For some reason he sensed danger He knew he shouldnt be in the file
room that if he were found his visit to Dr Minton might come to a
sudden end He couldnt take the chance He tiptoed to the front door
of the file room and turned the knob He slipped out and ran on his
toes down the empty corridor

Quickly without thought of the consequence Ron opened still another
door and closed it behind him

He looked at the shining brass fixtures and ultra modern appliances
and wondered what a kitchen was doing in a government medical building
Then when he heard a sound in the adjoining room he reasoned that he
had stumbled into someones living quarters

He went to a brown mahogany door and pushed against it gently until he
widened the crack sufficiently to make out the figure walking up and
down in the other room

When the man crossed his line of vision Rons breath tumbled out in a
gasp

It was his own body His thirtyyearold body with its sixfoottwo
frame of big bones and long muscles its sandy closecropped hair its
brooding eyes and full mouth It was Ron Carver It was himself as he
had been before

Heres the little rascal a voice said behind him

                                   

The crinklyhaired man took his arm roughly

Okay kid Lets hear it

Hear what Ron said plaintively I wasnt doing anything

Sure the guard sneered He wasnt doin a thing Just snoopin
around thats all

The swinging door opened

Whats going on here

Ron Carver looked at himself at his own face now strange and stony
at his own eyes now bright and disinterested at his own mouth now
a thin line of discontent He heard his own voice in a dangerous
inflection he had never known before

Sorry sir the guard said reddening Didnt know you were inside
Wouldnt have disturbed you

How did he get here

Gosh sir I really dont know He says he was lookin for Dr
Minton

Minton Ron Carvers voice said Yes of course He would be looking
for Minton wouldnt he

Sir

Never mind Bring the boy into my quarters Then get Dr Minton up
here at once

Yes sir

They pushed the swinging door open and shoved Ron ahead of them The
room was an anomaly in this pristine government building a warm room
of deepcolored woods and thick carpeting He was placed in a leather
chair his feet not touching the floor The two men exited and Ron
Carvers body walked to an oaken desk and sat in the padded swivel
chair behind the blotter

Well he said This is something of a surprise for me

And how about me Ron said hoarsely

The man laughed Yes we are both surprised Was it Robert Burns Yes
of course To see ourselves as others see us He chuckled and
reached for a cigarette Filthy habit this Dont know how I picked
it up Possibly a deepseated trait of yours Mr Carver Odd how
these things can be transferred

The door opened again

Dr Minton Ron leaped to his feet

The doctors face went white behind the gray beard and moustache

Then youve found him he said softly to neither of them in
particular

No Ron Carvers body answered I didnt find him doctor Rather
he found us Isnt that right Mr Carver

Yes Ron said And now I want to know the truth

I too need answers the Ronbody said stiffly I need answers at
once Dr Minton I would think this requires an explanation

I couldnt do it the doctor whispered I couldnt do what you
wanted Scholar

Do what Ron said

All right then the Ronbody said coldly You failed once But
youre far too intelligent to make the same mistake twice So you have
your assignment Dr Minton I will get you the help you need But kill
thisthis remnant

He turned away in disgust and picked up the telephone He spoke under
his breath for a few moments and then hung up Dr Luther will be
here in just a moment Hell arrange things with the laboratory It
will all be very painless and quick

Ron said What are you talking about He looked wildly towards the
old man who had aged even further since entering the room Dr
Minton

The door opened A brisk young man carrying a small valise appeared

All set downstairs he said

Good the Ronbody answered Then get it over with

Ron struggled for a moment in the young mans grip but he found it
iron

Please Ron Doctor Mintons eyes were moist Dont make any
trouble Please

                                   

The laboratory was in the basement of the building an antiseptic room
with the acrid odor of chemicals Dr Luther prepared something in a
hypodermic syringe while Dr Minton strapped his former patient onto
a padded examining table

Doctor  Ron whispered

Hush Ron Its all right

But what is all this Who am I

The doctor frowned Youre Ronald Carver Youre the same Ronald
Carver you always were But you have made an exchange of bodies That
is all

But why How

I dont really know God help us It was his project from start to
finishthat thing upstairs

Who is he

A phenomenon A mutation A freak A genius A god I cant explain
him He was born twelve years ago to normal parents in the middle
west He was a recognized prodigy at the age of six months a
mathematical wizard at one a scientific genius at three Youve
heard of this kind of thing Ron Once a generation something like
this And once a milleniuma horror like this one

I dont understand What is Project Scholar

He is All by himself The government has taken charge of his
abilities at least for the time being He snorted Hes already done
things I wouldnt have believed possible in five thousand years of
evolution And yet he is still only twelve years old

Only twelve Ron squirmed in the straps Doctor This body

Yes Ron Its his of course He grew angry with it wanted to
discard it like everything else which doesnt fit his conception of
the fitness of things It was awkwarda giants brain in a childs
body So he developed a solutionan operation involving the total
transference of electrical energy

The doctors shaggy head bowed He needed human help for that Thats
when I was brought in as assistant And it was my function to select
the perfect body as a temporary house for his ego

Temporary

When this body ages and grows feeble there will be another Our
friend has outwitted Death itself

The doctor looked up his jaw firm

I was instructed to destroy his body when the transference was
completed I couldnt do it Ron I managed to spirit you away where
you would be cared for It was almost a year before you came to your
senses after the operation By that time I didnt know what to do with
you My first thought was the Roverwood Home where I am a director
where you would be lost among many many boys faces

But why me doctor Why me

I had to choose someone Ron It was merely a question of who

Dr Luther entered priming the needle

Ready he said

One moment The doctors hand covered Rons mouth and he felt the
contours of a small round pill against his lips He realized he was
meant to swallow it and he did

Ready now Dr Minton said

Dr Luther performed the injection

Good night sweet prince he said gently

                                   

When Ron awoke it was under a blanket of darkness and ice

He blinked until his eyes became accustomed to the impoverished light
that was glowing behind a glasspaned door

He was on a block of some cold composition in what must have been the
Medical Centers morgue He reacted with revulsion at the thought
and leaped off Then he saw that his left hand was holding a sheet of
paper He carried it to the meager light source and read it quickly

    Ron

    Dont wait another moment Youll find a suit of clothes in the
    closet left Leave through back stairway marked N There is money
    in  suit Use it to leave the city Do not return if you value
    your safety  and the life of

                                                  M

He found the clothes as directed a neatlycut suit of boys clothing
with a small wallet stuffed with bills amounting to three hundred
dollars He dressed rapidly opened the door and peered down the hall
It was empty as he ran silently towards the exit marked N

Now he was doubly in debt to Dr Minton But he couldnt spare the
doctor even now for his life had been given a new direction and
purpose

He was going to kill the Scholar

He walked rapidly through the dark streets towards the public parking
lot where the helicopter had been stored He took the lift to the roof
and walked up to it quickly

Its about time pal

It was Shock his hair tousled over his hard bright eyes There was a
gun in his hand

Ive been waitin an hour you punk Think you were gettin off so
easy

Look Shock

You thought you were a clever boy didnt you Well I got news for
you

Look I dont want to be leader I just needed a copter for a few
hours

Yeah sure Only you forgot something We put Finder equipment on this
baby a long time ago so we could keep tabs on it

You can have the copter

I dont want just the copter Ronnie boy I want to square a few
things with you

Look Shock Ill make a deal with you Ill give you two hundred
bucks for that gun

The tall boys face changed What

You heard me You hand over that gun Ill give you two hundred
dollars

His eyes narrowed Then what I suppose youd shoot me and take off
Uhuh pal

You can check the gun downstairs and sell me the key

Okay Shock said slowly But if youre pullin something He
balled his hands menacingly

They went down to the lower level together Shock bought himself a
public locker and shoved the gun inside Then he held up the key

Here it is pal Two hundred bucks worth

Ron handed him the money Shock whistled at the sight of the bills

Now Ron said Would you like to make a hundred more

He looked at Ron with respect Okay Whats the pitch

I want you to make a phone call for me

Yeah sure Shock looked bewildered Then Ron explained

They reached the guard in the East Wing of the Medical Center without
much difficulty Shock crouched over the receiver and said

This is Dr Luther Somethings happened you better connect me with
him

Okay hold on

There was a wait Then Ron Carvers own voice in its eerie new
inflection was on the other end

What is it

This is Luther Somethings happened down here I think the boy got
away

What Where are you

In the morgue downstairs I think you better come down yourself

How could it happen The Ronvoice was raging How

I dont know But you better meet me here in ten minutes

Ron jabbed Shock in the side and the tall boy slammed the receiver
back into place with a relieved sigh

I dont get it he said Who was that guy

Me Ron said with a grim smile He handed Shock the money and
watched him depart still looking baffled Then he went to the locker
and removed the gun stuffing it inside his jacket It bulked large
against his narrow chest

He raced through the streets back to the medical center heading for
Exit N and the morgue

                                   

Ron was waiting gun poised behind the empty slab A shadow covered
the dim light behind the glassplated door and the Ronbody entered
the silent room

He saw his own hand reaching out to flick on the light switch He saw
his own face register dismay and annoyance at the quiet scene

Then the Ronbody turned and was about to leave

Stay awhile Ron said

He stood up revealing the weapon holding it in both of his small
hands for firm control of the trigger

Well his voice said

Yes well Ron answered Very well thanks Only I wont speak for
you Scholar Because I dont think youre well at all I think youre
out of your mind

The Ronlips curled

Naturally Genius is akin to madness Its one of the deeprooted
convictions of the human ego It reflects their suspicion their
distrust of the superintelligent  I understand you Mr Carver

And I dont understand you Youre something new to me Maybe youre
better than us maybe youre worse I dont know Scholar But thats
not why Im going to kill you

Oh

No You think I want to kill you for the sake of the world Because
youre a menace to homo sapiens Because of your contempt for us
ordinary mortals Hell no Scholar Im too ordinary myself Im
killing you for me for Ron Carver Because Im sore Just plain
sore

He raised the gun

For a moment Ron didnt know what had happened Something else blurred
his vision a fastmoving figure bulking up in front of his target It
was only when he heard the voice that he recognized the intruder as Dr
Minton and he saw then that the doctor had rescued the Scholar from
certain death

Stop Ron

Doctor Get out of the way

No Ron You dont know what youre doing

The old man was shielding the Ronbody with his own Ron put the weapon
down

But why he said

Because this is no answer This is the assassins way He turned to
the Ronbody and his voice was shaking Listen Scholar I want to
arbitrate Will you listen

Do I have a choice

Yes the doctor said fiercely Life or death Will you listen to my
terms

The Ronbody shrugged All right

Very well Then I want you to spare Ron Carver I want you to allow
me to deliver him into the hands of friends deliver him alive and
safe In return I promise that your twelveyearold body will leave
this Earth virtually at once I will send it to the colony on Mars
where it will stay until adulthood Will you allow this

The Scholars smile was thin And that is your only condition

My only one

Doctor Ron stepped towards him You cant leave things as they
are

Are you willing Scholar Will you let Ron Carver live his life in
peace

The Ronbody stiffened

Yes he snapped

Ron the doctor waved towards him Hand him your gun

What

Give it to him Weve made a pact

Ron hesitated and then extended the butt towards the Scholar He took
it with a slight bow weighed it in his palm and then slipped the
weapon into his pocket

You did wisely the doctor said with noticeable relief If you had
turned that gun on us Scholar I would have killed you on the spot
He patted the metallic bulk beneath his own coat I came prepared
too

                                   

The copter rose serenely towards the heavenly vault Rons small body
was feeling the effects of the days strain It collapsed against the
leathery cushions the short arms and legs limp and dangling

The doctor patted his knee Another few moments he said

Where are we going

To the spaceport in Winnipeg I have a friend there He has two
children of his own both born in the Mars Colony Hell be returning
there within the week

And you want me to go with him

Yes Ron I want you to grow up all over again and then return
to Earth It wont be easy for you but there will be advantages
Your life span has been lengthened And right now you know youre
something of a prodigy yourself He chuckled dryly

And what happens here Ron said bitterly What kind of Earth will I
find on my return

An older Earth Perhaps a wiser Earth

No doctor Ron forced himself to a sitting position Not with the
Scholar alive and thriving growing stronger and more intelligent with
every passing year Itll be his Earth when I return

The doctor stared at the night sky before answering

No Ron Hell never live to see it I knew that when I selected
your body to house his mind

What do you mean

I chose you for a reason Ron A vital reason When you came to my
office on your return from Andromeda I discovered something about you
which made up my mind An ailment without a name or a symptom found
only rarely in the bodies of a few space travelers You had it Ron
and in a year or two it would have struck you down with the savagery
and surprise of lightning

It was then that I agreed to the Scholars plan to exchange bodies
Agreed to it on my own terms with the body of Ron Carver

Then Ill die Ron said

No Ron You will live Its the Scholar who has made the bad
bargain

In the distance the lights of the Winnipeg spaceport blinked a welcome
